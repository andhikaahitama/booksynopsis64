From Petronius in ancient Rome to the 20th Century Japanese novelist Yukio Mishima, writers, more than any other kind of artist, have taken their own lives in an extraordinary number of ways. With bullets, poison, drugs and swords, poets, playwrights, novelists and philosophers have sent themselves off into the big sleep. Others, one step shy of that last exit, have made great literature about the urge to self-destruction. For the first time, Gary Lachman investigates the many links between self-death and the written word, bringing together an unusual gallery of literary greats and a host of other fatal characters. Typically for Dedalus, the cover s gorgeous. Sasha Selavie in QX International Dead Letters ultimately proves to be at once stimulating and thought-provoking and the section devoted to various suicidal writings is most diverting.

Mr. Berkow shares his enduring passion for the hardwood, which began in his boyhood in Chicago in the 1940s and '50s and has continued with the same vigor and competitive fire of his youth, often against opponents half his age. <i>To the Hoop</i> tells the story of a year in his basketball life, as he resolves to enhance his game and stave off the ravages of time. It's a wonderful and moving tale of love&#x2015;for the game, for his friends and family, and for life itself.<br><br>"An extraordinary look into the art of pickup basketball. Who would have guessed that, along with his writing talents, Ira knows how to play the game!"&#x2015;Bill Bradley<br><br>"A wonderful book&#x2015;not just for basketball fans but for everyone."&#x2015;Earvin "Magic" Johnson<br><br>"Ira Berkow is one of the best sportswriters around, so it is no surprise that his basketball odyssey is one of the best sports books of this or any other year."&#x2015;George Plimpton</p><p>"Through the game," writes <i>New York Times</i> sports columnist Ira Berkow about basketball, "I have an unusual opportunity to look into the soul of others, as well as, the spirit and wisdom willing, my own." At 52, following a knee injury, he was told he would never hit the hardwood again. Four years later, he exposed his soul--and knee--to tests of self-discovery in pick-up games from Manhattan playgrounds to California beaches. The mid-life memoir, filled with wisdom from unusual places, is about far more than a game: "Autumn," NBA legend Oscar Robertson tells the author, "happens to everybody," and Berkow discovers much that is moving, exuberant, and beautiful in his personal change of seasons.Pulitzer prize-winning author Ira Berkow has written sports and occasional features for the <i>New York Times</i> for more than twenty years.

S.)</h2><p>In the book that he was born to write, provocateur and best-selling author Christopher Hitchens inspires future generations of radicals, gadflies, mavericks, rebels, angry young (wo)men, and dissidents. Who better to speak to that person who finds him or herself in a contrarian position than Hitchens, who has made a career of disagreeing in profound and entertaining ways.This book explores the entire range of &#34;contrary positions&#34;-from noble dissident to gratuitous pain in the butt. In an age of overly polite debate bending over backward to reach a happy consensus within an increasingly centrist political dialogue, Hitchens pointedly pitches himself in contrast. He bemoans the loss of the skills of dialectical thinking evident in contemporary society. He understands the importance of disagreement-to personal integrity, to informed discussion, to true progress-heck, to democracy itself. Epigrammatic, spunky, witty, in your face, timeless and timely, this book is everything you would expect from a mentoring contrarian.</p><p>"Do justice, and let the skies fall." Christopher Hitchens borrows from Roman antiquity this touchstone for a career of confrontation, argument, and troublemaking. Part of the Art of Mentoring series, <i>Letters to a Young Contrarian</i> is a trim volume of about two dozen letters to an imaginary student of controversy. The letters are wonderfully engaging--Hitchens is an exceptional prose stylist--and from the outset they strike a self-reflective note. What Hitchens lionizes and illuminates in this book is not any particular disagreement, but a way of being perpetually at odds with the mainstream. "Humanity is very much in debt to such people," he argues.<p> Hitchens's style is incendiary and sometimes flamboyant. He relishes the role of provocateur and fancies himself a gadfly to the drowsy American republic. One of his main strengths is his erudition, allowing him to range over vast landscapes of the humanities and politics in a single breath. But he is also sometimes glib and self-satisfied, and his penchant for referencing everything in sight can be distracting. Nonetheless, his arguments are forceful and morally important--and if the reader feels otherwise, there are few more fitting compliments to a professional dissident than dissent. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><b>Christopher Hitchens</b> is a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>.

She must, in a single year, come to terms with radiant beginnings and profound loss. <b>MotherKind</b> is a delicately layered narrative in which the details of daily life resonate with import and meaning.<br><br>We enter Kate's present world of first and second families, babies and lively stepchildren, neighbors and friends, baby-sitters and wise strangers. Images of her not-so-long-ago past intermingle in a turning of the seasons marked by the gradual fading of her mother, the strong woman who has been her friend, her guiding star and her counterpart across a divide of experience and years.<br><br><b>MotherKind</b> immerses us in a very contemporary situation, yet deals with timeless themes. Even as Kate's relationship with her mother embodies her childhood and adolescence in another place, she must decide what "home" is, and how to translate all she has come from into what she will carry forward. As her baby grows and her mother becomes increasingly ill, Kate realizes how inextricably linked we are, even in separation -- across generations, cultures, time; across death itself.<br><br>It is the triumph of <b>MotherKind</b> that Kate's complex experience of being -- and losing -- a mother is so deeply and luminously portrayed.</p><p>Although we know from its first page that the protagonist's mother is dying of cancer, Jayne Anne Phillips's rich, involving novel is not a story of loss but of connection. Thirty-year-old Kate, an unmarried poet, has traveled home to tell her mother, Katherine, that she is expecting a child. A few months later, Katherine will be compelled to move into her daughter's chaotic suburban household. <blockquote> The birth of Kate's baby approached and her mother consented to chemotherapy, consented to leaving home, consented to never going home again, where she'd lived all her life. She crossed all those lines in her wheelchair, without a whimper, moving down an airport walkway. In its cage, her little dog made a sound. "Hush," she said. </blockquote> For the balance of <i>MotherKind</i>, the narrative focus shifts between this visit to the country--like time travel to a sepia-toned world of unpolluted streams, flowering meadows, and rural gas stations--and the new life Kate is building with Matt, her unruly stepsons, and newborn Alexander, while Katherine slowly dies upstairs. As Phillips moves back and forth, she emphasizes the continuity of human life, rather than individual endings or beginnings, and functions like thought itself: obsessively returning to a few prized details, puzzling over old mysteries, making occasional random discoveries or unexpected insights, like treasures turned up by a garden hoe. Recalling her sadness and admiration as she watched her mother rolling toward her in the airport wheelchair, Kate is struck by a realization that "all lines of transit came together in a starry radiance too bright to observe," a magical realm where "manly cowboys glanced away from death and rode on through big-skyed plains and sage."<p> Though her third novel may contain all the emotional ingredients of a made-for-television movie, Phillips avoids tear-jerking through the use of precisely observed details (the plastic medicine spoon for her mother's morphine, the Christmas songs that double as lullabies for little Alexander) and the absence of clich�. She has even side-stepped, at the end, the requisite death-bed scene, knowing that there is almost no way left to write about such moments without recourse to received language and images. <i>MotherKind</i> uncovers the mixed sources of maternal strength in love, habit, and necessity. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>"Luminous...An exploration of the incongruities, the paradoxes, the mystifying jigsaw pieces that make our existence on this planet unquenchably compelling."<br>-- <i>Mirabella</i><br><p>"A passionate but indirect evocation of loss . . . Phillips concentrates on the day-to-day details of ordinary existence suddenly afflicted with extraordinaray pressures and the conflicting tugs of joy and grief."<br>-- <i>Time</i><br></p><p>"This deeply felt, profoundly affecting novel, her best so far, exhibits a maturity of vision both keen and wistful.... Phillips explores the intuitive bond between mothers and daughters with unforced grace.... Compassionate and spiritually nourishing."<br> -- <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br></p><p>"The story brims with vivid pictures of day-to-day family life, revealed largely through dialogue, which Phillips unerringly captures with consummate authenticity."<br>-- <i>Booklist</i><br></p><p>"A gorgeous novel...With gentle insight and uncanny feeling, [she] brings [her] fascinating, disparate characters to brilliant, memorable life."<br>-- <i>Elle</i><br></p><p>"A stunning meditation on family."<br>-- Salon.com<br></p><p>"A beautiful and moving work of fiction that celebrates the sacredness of ordinary life."<br>-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br></p><p>"An abundantly talented writer."<br>-- <i>The New Yorker</i><br></p><p>"A pitch-perfect novel...A book on understanding who you are when everything you knew has disappeared...Too few books touch on the ferocity of women's lives, the intense will it takes to shepherd births and deaths without shrinking. <b>MotherKind</b> is the rare one that tells that truth."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-- <i>Detroit Free Press</i><br></p></p><h2>Tantra Between the Sheets: The Easy and Fun Guide to Mind-Blowing Sex</h2><p>Tantra may be a 5,000-year-old spiritual tradition, but it&#39;s also an astonishingly powerful tool for contemporary sexual empowerment. Tantra Between the Sheets teaches Tantric techniques that enable men and women to gain sexual confidence, become multiorgasmic, and satisfy their partner in the most intimate, soulful ways. Similar to yoga or meditation, Tantra is about accessing the energy stored within the body and being alive to all the senses. Whether readers are interested in deepening their current relationship, discovering more about sexuality, or simply picking up some great sex tips, Tantra Between the Sheets shows how surprisingly easy it is for anyone to benefit from this ancient practice. This book is beautifully designed with a hip, stylish look that includes 40 black-and-white photographs.</p><p>Val Sampson is a journalist who writes for a variety of national UK newspapers and magazines including The Times and Good Housekeeping. She began writting about Tantra for a short article because she thought it sounded like a sexy, fun subject that would spice up dinner-party conversation and impress a few friends. But the more she learned about Tantra, the more impressed she was with its ability to transform poeple's sex life and personal relationships. She ended up spending a year researching the subject and interviewing dozens of people for this book.<br>Chapter 1<br>ENERGY IS ETERNAL DELIGHT<br><br>Tantra is about the flow and exchange of energy, the movement of life. Tantrics believe that the most powerful energy is sexual energy. Tantric practice shows you how to circulate this energy around your own body and then move it between you and your partner. You will discover how to take the sexual feelings you have in your genitals and to move them up to different areas of your body and ultimately to your brain, where they are experienced as ecstasy. As this energy moves through your body, it sets off fireworks en route.<br><br>What Westerners think of as getting turned on or horny, Tantrics and Taoists think of generating sexual energy. You can be in touch with this powerful energy all the time. But you'll probably be glad to know that this does not result in feeling unbearably aroused 24 hours a day. Tantra teaches you how to have access to this energy and how to store it in your body. So, instead of being subject to uncontrollable sexual urges, you feel more creative, more alive and more in touch with your senses as you go about your daily life. You can shop, work, play and get fit with a spring in your step and a positive sense of wellbeing.<br><br>In the West we tend to think the only way we can get in touch with our sexual energy is through someone else. Couples in tired marriages, for example, may feel tempted by an affair that will make them feel alive again. Meeting someone new is certainly one way of accessing that giddy and exciting sense of being in love, but it is not the only way. Tantra teaches us that the powerful sexual energy that we think can only be ignited by another person exists in us all the time. And we can learn how to channel it for ourselves.<br><br>As the poet William Blake wrote: Energy is eternal delight.<br><br>BOOSTING YOUR ENERGY<br><br>If at times you feel tired and lethargic, there are some pretty straightforward ways of giving yourself an instant energy boost. Instead of opting for a strong coffee to wake you up, try breathing deeply to increase your intake of oxygen, so that your belly expands as you fill your lungs. Take up to seven deep breaths in and out, then revert to normal breathing, and continue this pattern until you start to feel your body kick-start into action. (Breathing deeply for too long when you are unaccustomed to it will make you feel dizzy, so stop and breath normally if you begin to feel light-headed).<br><br>Alterntively, start to move; ideally to dance or run. Energy is blocked when you slump onto the sofa and released when your body and limbs begin to move. Experience a double whammy with the addition of soound, another positive source of energy, by putting on a CD that makes you want to dance. If you are dubious about the benefits of dancing, just think about why people dance when they go partner-hunting at parties. Dancing has been described as the vertical expression of a horizontal desire and when you dance with someone you find attractive, you are actually stirring up sexual energy in your body, ready to use later.<br><br>Get dancing and within minutes you will feel more awake and you will find your brain is less sluggish. If you are someone who is uncomfortable with the idea of dancing either publicly or in private, resolve to give it another try without judging yourself while you do it. If you still find the idea of dancing about as appealing as an hors d'oeuvres of Pedigree Chum, run on he spot or do a few bends and stretches instead.<br><br>Still uncertain what energy feels like? Try this experiment. Vigorously shake your right hand for a minute or so. When you stop and hold it in front of you, bring your left hand, palms facing, gently towards it, and you should feel a vibrating sensation around the hand that has been shaken. It may feel pleasantly buzzy and warm, or it may even feel larger than the unshaken hand.<br><br>By shaking your hand yoou have charged it with energy and if you place your attention there you will feel it. One of the things that Tantra does is to teach you how to generate and move this warm, tingly energy throughout your body.<br></p><h2>The Bride&#39;s Matchmaking Triplets (Lone Star Cowboy League: Multiple Blessings, 3)</h2><p><em><b>Marriage by Necessity</b></em><em><b>&nbsp;</b></em><br><br>When mail-order bride Elizabeth Dumont's intended weds another, her only option is to take a job as nanny to abandoned triplet babies.

For Callum Israel, leader of the Ninth Wave oceanic activist group, this is the question that cuts to the core of his identity. In a post-war, post-Crash, post-disaster, post-everything world, nothing is certain and ideologies are meaningless. But the mission remains: search this crumbling world for answers to the cause of the Crash, and keep up the hunt for their missing sister ship, The Massive, lost and adrift in the chaos.

No longer content with merely being the crime lord the Penguin, he yearns for the love of Gotham City.

Collects issues #13-18.</p><p>Once an editor for Wildstorm, John Layman turned to writing comics full-time in 2002 and mainly wrote for Marvel Comics. However, he is mostly known for his creator-owned titles at Image Comics, such as the graphic novel Puffed and the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning series <i>Chew</i>. He currently writes the monthly adventures of the Dark Knight in DETECTIVE COMICS.After a sluggish start to Detective Comics, Layman, critical darling and author of the runaway hit Chew, has taken over as series writer and, thankfully, brings his signature wit and marvelous storytelling along with him. This installment of the series sends Batman on a wild penguin chase across the rooftops of Gotham City, where he finds himself fighting a classic rogue&#x2019;s gallery of Poison Ivy, Clayface, and Merrymaker. What the Dark Knight doesn&#x2019;t expect is a rising criminal star, looking to take over the Penguin&#x2019;s territory. Layman takes the Caped Crusader back to his detective roots, complete with a crossover tie-in as the Joker turns Gotham City into his own twisted playground. Though Layman&#x2019;s name on the cover will be the big draw, artists Fabok and Clarke are up to the challenge, often delivering outside-the-box paneling and vibrant splash pages. In his first arc on the series, Layman&#x2019;s approach to Batman is both delightfully nostalgic and surprisingly new, making this a perfect fit for fans of classic Batman. --Ben Spanner</p><h2>Taoism: The quest for immortality</h2><p>A religion with roots stretching back nearly five thousand years, Taoism combines elements of folklore, occult sciences, cosmology, yoga, meditation, poetry, and exalted mysticism. Mysterious and charmingly poetic, it is a living remnant of a way of life which has almost vanished from the world. <br><br>In this comprehensive study, John Blofeld explains the fundamental concepts of Taoism, tells many stories of ancient masters, and provides incisive reflections on Taoist verse. He writes in a colorful and unique way about his visits to Taoist hermitages in China and his interchanges with contemporary masters. Taoist yoga, a little known aspect of Taoist practice, is also discussed in detail.

Richardson's story is of a pushing, prickly, fiercely ambitious apothecary's son from Yorkshire for whom waiting on his father's customers was ``an embarrassment and a threat,'' who went up to Oxford (``I see ropes--nothing but ropes,'' he effused while creating an experimental production of Peer Gynt) and then made an indelible mark on the British stage, long moldering, with the founding of the Royal Court Theatre, which launched landmark productions of plays such as Look Back In Anger and The Entertainer. Richardson went on to work a great deal in film, flying by the seat of his pants in A Taste of Honey, The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, The Loved One, Tom Jones, and others. Because his work consumed him, his life-story is primarily a project-by-project serial telling, enlivened by savagely amusing pronouncements on the luminaries in his milieu who either rankled him or didn't suitably serve his artistic vision. Famous bodies are everywhere. Richardson is strongest here when the haughty boy from Yorkshire goes ga-ga over Jeanne Moreau and gets what his father might have called a taste of his own medicine, and he's interesting but idiosyncratic in writing of Vanessa Redgrave, the rather magnificent wife he spurned (and toward whom he reveals a great deal--or so it might seem--of unconscious hostility). Oddly, there's not one reference to Redgrave's politics, though they certainly affected Richardson's life and nerves; nor does the author acknowledge his own widely reputed bisexuality. Introduced by Joan Didion, with a foreword by Richardson's daughter Natasha, who says she found the memoir in a cupboard on the day of her father's death. Meanwhile, Didion claims it was given to Natasha by the manuscript typist. They should have talked- -though Richardson sparkles here nonetheless. (Thirty-two pages of b&amp;w photos) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Movie and stage director Richardson (<i>Tom Jones</i>, <i>Hotel New Hampshire</i>) writes an autobiography that is at once compelling and disappointing. His childhood of separation and alienation is reminiscent of a Dickens novel both in tone and in description, and the British class system receives much of the blame. But the story and mood change as Richardson attends Oxford and begins his directorial apprenticeship. His personality, so vividly revealed in the introductory chapters, is diminished if not exactly lost. There is much behind-the-scenes information about the stage and movie industry, and Richardson is not afraid to explore the personalities of important actors and actresses, such as Laurence Olivier. The intricacies of moviemaking concern much of the book's last half, from the financing of movies to working with quirky (when not outright deranged) actors and actresses. Of Richardson the person there are many details but there is little resonance--except in a few places, as where he admits that <i>Tom Jones</i>, his biggest success and recipient of the Academy Award for Best Picture was "botched" and "incomplete." Still, a strong picture of the acting industry and what it takes to succeed. <i>Brian McCombie</i></p><h2>The Marches</h2><p>4th impression, shelf wear to dust jacket, corners have a little bumping.

Mr. Gammell lives with his wife, Linda, in St. Paul, Minnesota.[Editor's Note: The following is a combined review with LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE, PICKLES FROM PITTSBURGH, CHATO'S KITCHEN, and PETE'S A PIZZA.]--Special relationships between characters are the stuff of engaging stories. Each character becomes a vivid part of the listener's imagination. In THE RELATIVES CAME, the annual summer trip is fondly remembered. Similar car trips, greetings, spreads of food and conversation, and bulging houses will spring to mind. The relaxed pace of this recording provides the time to savor these memories. In PICKLES TO PITTSBURGH, Judi Barrett revisits the wonderful world of Chewandswallow, featuring immense foodstuffs, and from this world distinct characters emerge. Listeners will appreciate the interplay of Grandpa's adventure with Kate's dream and the relationships of the fantastic foods. In PETE'S A PIZZA, Pete is in a terrible state, and it is his father who has the wisdom to humor him back to his usual self by making Pete into a pizza pie. The giggles of Pete and the listeners increase as Pete is kneaded, stretched, spread, baked, and (almost) sliced. Food is also center stage in CHATO'S KITCHEN. In hospitable fashion, Chato invites his new neighbors to dinner. Dreaming of a mouse feast, Chato and his cat buddy think up and stir up a delicious meal with Spanish flavor, only to be greeted at the door by the mice and their special guest. The twist in the anticipated outcome and the deep richness of Chato's voice are memorable. While special treats baked for school are a part of the story, it is the interaction of Lilly with her teacher that is central and poignant in LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE. Their days have ups and downs in typical childlike mode as only Kevin Henkes can portray. Will Lilly weather the humiliation when Mr. Slinger takes (just for the day) her prized new possession? In this recording Lilly is enjoyably squeaky, and Mr. Slinger is kindly authoritative and wise. Background voices are used effectively to interject the "bubble stories" from the text. While listening to this collection of stories is a distinct pleasure, the illustrations help to make the experience memorable. Listen, look, and enjoy!

This biography offers a portrait of the Nobel Prize-winning German novelist, drawing on Mann&#39;s unexpurgated diaries. It uncovers a brilliant writer&#39;s mask to reveal the private man: his bisexuality, his obsession with preserving appearances and the deep guilt which plagued him for nearly fifty years. The sanitized self-image Mann strove to maintain is revealed as a fragile veneer. Drawing on the diaries that he stipulated should remain under seal for twenty years after his death, and on interviews with Mann&#39;s children, the author depicts a man subject to nervous trembling, convulsive sobbing and moments of sexual embarrassment. When his novels are reread from this perspective, new meanings emerge and interconnections between the problems of the author and his characters become apparent. As Mann wrote to a friend, he devised &#34;novelistic forms and masks which can be displayed in public as a means of relaying my love, my hatred, my sympathy, my contempt, my pride, my scorn and the accusations I want to make&#34;. The author is the biographer of Proust, Sartre, Kafka, Nietzche, Brecht and Sylvia Plath.</p><p>The "last great European man of letters," 1929 Nobel Prize winner Thomas Mann took great pains to cultivate a public persona of calm, assured elegance. He successfully masked the "interior chaos" and self-disgust that so plagued his private life and, as this fine biography shows, became so much a part of his fiction. Using Mann's copious diaries, his letters, and interviews with his children, Hayman draws detailed autobiographical parallels to Mann's writings. Early stories such as "The Clown," "Tonio Kruger," and "Little Herr Friedemann" contain elements that, when examined next to Mann's diaries, reveal his frustrated bisexuality, his fits of depression, and his frequent illnesses. Mann married in 1905 following an affair with a young painter named Paul Ehrenburg; he admits he "liked" Katia and "admired her" but consciously sacrificed "his natural inclination on the altar of his public image." This psychosexual analysis would grow tiresome, though, if Hayman failed to equally amplify the political, social, and literary man. Mann's vocal opposition to Hitler and the Nazis would result in his exile from Germany during the years 1933 to 1949. In an almost day-by-day examination of Mann's life, Hayman traces the writer's decades-long feud with his brother Heinrich; studies in detail his literary career from its beginnings to <i>The Magic Mountain</i> (1924), <i>Doctor Faustus</i> (1948), and <i>The Genesis of a Novel</i> (1961); and looks at his association with Hermann Hesse, Bruno Walter, Bertolt Brecht, and others. A heavy, heady work, worthy of this German master. <i>Ron Antonucci</i>German novelist Thomas Mann (1875-1955) played an almost heroic role in keeping German culture alive, and in opposing Hitler, after Germany had surrendered to Nazism; yet this major, dramatic biography reveals a writer who was deeply ambivalent about the Jewishness of his wife, Katia, and who tried, for the first three years of their exile in Switzerland, not to condemn the Nazis publicly. According to Hayman, Mann was terrified the Nazis would get hold of the diaries he had left behind, expose his bisexuality and ruin his reputation. Living behind the facade of married respectability, the guilt-ridden Mann, as the diaries disclose, felt passionate attractions toward boys and young men, including his friend the painter Paul Ehrenburg-though he never "took the step from homoeroticism into homosexuality," in Hayman's analysis. Indispensable for understanding Mann's novels and stories, this literary biography unearths startling connections between his life and work. Prone to convulsive sobbing and fits of nausea, Mann was an aloof father to his six children, two of whom committed suicide. Hayman, biographer of Brecht and Nietzsche, strips away the cultivated mask to plumb a divided soul, "the last great European man of letters" in Hayman's assessment.

Born in Australia, he now lives in New York City.Chapter 1 <br><br>There were no photographs of the boy's father in the house upstate. He had been persona non grata since Christmas 1964, six months before the boy was born. There were plenty of pictures of his mom. There she was with short blond hair, her eyes so white against her tan. And that was her also, with black hair, not even a sister to the blonde girl, although maybe they shared a kind of bright attention. <br><br>She was an actress like her grandma, it was said. She could change herself into anyone. The boy had no reason to disbelieve this, not having seen his mother since the age of two. She was the prodigal daughter, the damaged saint, like the icon that Grandpa once brought back from Athens&#x2014;shining silver, musky incense&#x2014;although no one had ever told the boy how his mother smelled. <br><br>Then, when the boy was almost eight, a woman stepped out of the elevator into the apartment on East Sixty-second Street and he recognized her straightaway. No one had told him to expect it. <br><br>That was pretty typical of growing up with Grandma Selkirk. You were some kind of lovely insect, expected to know things through your feelers, by the kaleidoscope patterns in the others' eyes. No one would dream of saying, Here is your mother returned to you. Instead his grandma told him to put on his sweater. She collected her purse, found her keys and then all three of them walked down to Bloomingdale's as if it were a deli. This was normal life. Across Park, down Lex. The boy stood close beside the splendid stranger with the lumpy khaki pack strapped onto her back. That was her blood, he could hear it now, pounding in his ears. He had imagined her a wound-up spring, light, bright, blonde, like Grandma in full whir. She was completely different; she was just the same. By the time they were in Bloomingdale's she was arguing about his name. <br><br>What did you just call Che? she asked the grandma. <br><br>His name, replied Grandma Selkirk, ruffling the boy's darkening summer hair. That's what I called him. She gave the mother a bright white smile. The boy thought, Oh, oh! <br><br>It sounded like Jay, the mother said. <br><br>The grandma turned sharply to the shopgirl who was busy staring at the hippie mother. <br><br>Let me try the Artemis. <br><br>Grandma Selkirk was what they call an Upper East Side woman&#x2014;cheekbones, tailored gray hair&#x2014;but that was not what she called herself. I am the last bohemian, she liked to say, to the boy, particularly, meaning that no one told her what to do, at least not since Pa Selkirk had thrown the Buddha out the window and gone to live with the Poison Dwarf. <br><br>Grandpa had done a whole heap of other things besides, like giving up his board seat, like going spiritual. When Grandpa moved out, Grandma moved out too. The Park Avenue apartment was hers, always had been, but now they used it maybe once a month. Instead they spent their time on Kenoza Lake near Jeffersonville, New York, a town of 400 where "no one" lived. Grandma made raku pots and rowed a heavy clinker boat. The boy hardly saw his grandpa after that, except sometimes there were postcards with very small handwriting. Buster Selkirk could fit a whole ball game on a single card. <br><br>For these last five years it had been just Grandma and the boy together and she threaded the squirming live bait to hook the largemouth bass and, also, called him Jay instead of Che. There were no kids to play with. There were no pets because Grandma was allergic. But in fall there were Cox's pippins, wild storms, bare feet, warm mud and the crushed-glass stars spilling across the cooling sky. You can't learn these things anywhere, the grandma said. She said she planned to bring him up Victorian. It was better than "all this." <br><br>He was christened Che, right? <br><br>Grandma's wrist was pale and smooth as a flounder's belly. The sunny side of her arm was brown but she had dabbed the perfume on the white side&#x2014;blue blood, that's what he thought, looking at the veins. <br><br>Christened? His father is a Jew, the grandma said. This fragrance is too old for her, she told the Bloomingdale's woman who raised a cautious eyebrow at the mother. The mother shrugged as if to say, What are you going to do? Too floral, Grandma Selkirk said without doubting she would know. <br><br>So it's Jay? <br><br>Grandma spun around and the boy's stomach gave a squishy sort of lurch. Why are you arguing with me? she whispered. Are you emotionally tone-deaf? <br><br>The salesgirl pursed her lips in violent sympathy. <br><br>Give me the Chanel, said Grandma Selkirk. While the salesgirl wrapped the perfume, Grandma Selkirk wrote a check. Then she took her pale kid gloves from the glass countertop. The boy watched as she drew them onto each finger, thick as eel skin. He could taste it in his mouth. <br><br>You want me to call him Che in Bloomingdale's, his grandma hissed, finally presenting the gift to the mother. <br><br>Shush, the mother said. <br><br>The grandma raised her eyebrows violently. <br><br>Go with the flow, said the mother. The boy petted her on the hip and found her soft, uncorseted. <br><br>The flow? The grandma had a bright, fright smile and angry light blue eyes. Go with the flow! <br><br>Thank you, the girl said, for shopping at Bloomingdale's. <br><br>The grandma's attention was all on the mother. Is that what Communists believe? Che, she cried, waving her gloved hand as in charades. <br><br>I'm not a Communist. OK? <br><br>The boy wanted only peace. He followed up behind, his stomach churning. <br><br>Che, Che! Go with the flow! Look at you! Do you think you could make yourself a tiny bit more ridiculous? <br><br>The boy considered his illegal mother. He knew who she was although no one would say it outright. He knew her the way he was used to knowing everything important, from hints and whispers, by hearing someone talking on the phone, although this particular event was so much clearer, had been since the minute she blew into the apartment, the way she held him in her arms and squeezed the air from him and kissed his neck. He had thought of her so many nights and here she was, exactly the same, completely different&#x2014;honey-colored skin and tangled hair in fifteen shades. She had Hindu necklaces, little silver bells around her ankles, an angel sent by God. <br><br>Grandma Selkirk plucked at the Hindu beads. What is this? This is what the working class is wearing now? <br><br>I am the working class, she said. By definition.<br><br> The boy squeezed the grandma's hand but she snatched it free. Where's his father? They keep showing his face on television. Is he going with the flow as well? <br><br>The boy burped quietly in his hand. No one could have heard him but Grandma brushed at the air, as if grabbing at a fly. I called him Jay because I was worried for you, she said at last. Maybe it should have been John Doe. God help me, she cried, and the crowds parted before her. Now I understand I was an idiot to worry. <br><br>The mother raised her eyebrows at the boy and, finally, reached to take his hand. He was pleased by how it folded around his, soothing, comfortable. She tickled his palm in secret. He smiled up. She smiled down. All around them Grandma raged. <br><br>For this, we paid for Harvard. She sighed. Some Rosenbergs. <br><br>The boy was deaf, in love. By now they were out on Lexington Avenue and his grandma was looking for a taxi. The first cab would be theirs, always was. Except that now his hand was inside his true mother's hand and they were marsupials running down into the subway, laughing.<br><br>In Bloomingdale's everything had been so white and bright with glistening brass. Now they raced down the steps. He could have flown. <br><br>At the turnstiles she released his hand and pushed him under. She slipped off her pack. He was giddy, giggling. She was laughing too. They had entered another planet, and as they pushed down to the platform the ceiling was slimed with alien rust and the floor was flecked and speckled with black gum&#x2014;so this was the real world that had been crying to him from beneath the grating up on Lex. <br><br>They ran together to the local, and his heart was pounding and his stomach was filled with bubbles like an ice-cream float. She took his hand once more and kissed it, stumbling. <br><br>The 6 train carried him through the dark, wire skeins unraveling, his entire life changing all at once. He burped again. The cars swayed and screeched, thick teams of brutal cables showing in the windowed dark. And then he was in Grand Central first time ever and they set off underground again, hand in hand, slippery together as newborn goats. <br><br>Men lived in cardboard boxes. A blind boy rattled dimes and quarters in a tin. The S train waited, painted like a warrior, and they jumped together and the doors closed as cruel as traps, chop, chop, chop, and his face was pushed against his mother's jasmine dress. Her hand held the back of his head. He was underground, as Cameron in 5D had predicted. They will come for you, man. They'll break you out of here. <br><br>In the tunnels between Times Square and Port Authority a passing freak raised his fist. Right On! he called. <br><br>He knew you, right? <br><br>She made a face. <br><br>He's SDS? <br><br>She could not have expected that&#x2014;he had been studying politics with Cameron. <br><br>PL? he asked. <br><br>She sort of laughed. Listen to you, she said. Do you know what SDS stands for? <br><br>Students for a Democratic Society, he said. PL is Progressive Labor. They're the Maoist fraction. See, you're famous. I know all about you. <br><br>I don't think so. <br><br>You're sort of like the Weathermen. <br><br>I'm what? <br><br>I'm pretty sure.<br><br>Wrong fraction, baby. <br><br>She was teasing him. She shouldn't. He had thought about her every day, forever, lying on the dock beside the lake, where she was burnished, angel sunlight.

Beale started chronicling the D.C. social circuit during the Truman era, attending an estimated 15,000 parties before retiring in January 1989. Her capsule portraits of the entertaining styles of the various Presidents, however, hold few surprises. The Kennedys were elegant, although things sometimes got a little raucous in private (Beale cites parties at Bobby and Ethel Kennedy's during which Ethel repeatedly pushed fully dressed guests into the pool). LBJ was gregarious; Carter had the White House menu printed in English instead of French. The Reagans window-dressed events with Hollywood types. More amusing than Beale's party critique is her avalanche of minutiae representing the society columnist's stock in trade. She compares notes about chihuahuas with Haile Selassie, talks about pride with Imelda Marcos. She describes the pair of throne-like chairs that the Eisenhowers occupied during state dinners, and reveals that the hors d'oeuvres were generous in the Kennedy White House, and that LBJ was a dance partner ``with a good sense of rhythm.'' Beale scolds the Carters for including Amy in formal dinners and adamantly defends Nancy Reagan's china acquisition. And while the author doesn't share much about the nuts and bolts of her job, she does tell all about a three-year affair with Adlai Stevenson, even quoting from corny love poems she sent him. Beale clearly is a pro in her specialized world. Readers seeking fresh social or political gossip will come away hungry, but those who thrill to hear Nixon describe himself as ``an earring man'' will find lots to nibble on at this trivia-laden buffet. (Photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In her ebullient autobiography, Washington Evening Star reporter and syndicated society columnist Beale pours forth a glittering store of anecdotes concerning national leaders, royalty, diplomats and celebrities of all kinds. A Washington insider by birth, she has attended some 15,000 functions since 1945, including many at the White House, whose occupants' varied styles and treatment of the press inspire her most pungent comments. Beale is equally forthcoming about the male-dominated power structure and her love affair, during the years he was ambassador to the U.N., with Adlai Stevenson. She notes the large extent to which public policy is shaped at private parties, whose attendees respect social amenities regardless of political tensions among them. This memoir should appeal to history buffs and gossipmongers alike.

The cause of death is unclear, the only clues being a half glass of red wine and a partially eaten chunk of bread by his side that echo the ancient religious practice of sin-eating.Called to the scene, forensic scientist Rhona MacLeod is perplexed by the lack of evidence. But when another body is found near her own flat, laid out in a similar manner, she fears a forensically aware killer stalks the city and is marking the victims with their unique signature. Even more worryingly, the killer appears to be using skills they may have learned while attending her forensic science lectures at Glasgow University.There are signs that Rhona is being targeted, that the killer is playing with her and the police, drawing them into a deadly race against time, before the sin-eater&#x2019;s next victim is chosen . . .Sins of the Dead is the thrilling thirteenth book in Lin Anderson&#x2019;s Rhona MacLeod series.</p><p>Lin Anderson has published numerous novels and one novella featuring forensic scientist Dr Rhona MacLeod, which have been widely translated.

When the first Puritans sailed into Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, weak from the ocean journey, they formed a covenant with each other and with God to establish a city on a hill-a commitment to live uncorrupted lives together or all suffer divine wrath for their collective sin. But now, a century later, the arrival of one doomed ship would put this covenant to its greatest test.<p></p> <p>On April 22, 1721, the HMS <em>Seahorse </em>arrived in Boston from the West Indies, carrying goods, cargo, and, unbeknownst to its crew, a deadly virus. Soon, a smallpox epidemic had broken out in Boston, causing hundreds of deaths and panic across the city. The clergy, including the famed Cotton Mather, turned to their standard form of defense against disease: fasting and prayer. But a new theory was also being offered to the public by the scientific world: inoculation. The fierce debate over the right way to combat the tragedy would become a battle between faith and reason, one that would set the city aflame with rage and riot.</p> <p><em>The Pox and the Covenant </em>is a story of well known figures such as Cotton Mather, James Franklin, and a young Benjamin Franklin struggling to fight for their cause among death and debate-although not always for the side one would expect. In the end, the incredible results of the epidemic and battle would reshape the colonists' view of their destiny, setting for America a new course, a new covenant, and the first drumbeats of revolution.</p> <p><b>Praise for Pox and the Covenant:</b></p> <p>"A welcome shade of gray into the traditional depiction of Puritans as repressive and closed-minded" - Boston Globe</p> <p>"A fascinating aside to American medical history." - Publisher's Weekly</p> <p>"With present-day controversy over vaccination, everything old is new again.

He is currently a full-time author who lives in Williamsburg, Virginia, with his wife and children.<p>On September 6, 1620, the Puritans aboard the <em>Mayflower </em>departed on their religious errand into the American wilderness. They were Separatists who fled on their divinely ordained mission to escape persecution and establish a pure church free of the Catholic corruptions of the Anglican Church. As chronicler William Bradford wrote, in England, "religion has been disgraced, the godly aggrieved, afflicted, persecuted.... Sin has been countenanced, ignorance, profanity, and atheism have increased, and the papists have been encouraged." The Puritan church in the New World would recover its ancient biblical purity and be a model for the English Church; the Separatists could then return to their Mother Country.</p> <p>The <em>Mayflower </em>sailed from Plymouth for the New World, Bradford wrote, with a "prosperous wind." The crowded vessel measured roughly one hundred feet in length and was rated at 180 tons. Her sister ship, the <em>Speedwell</em>, had proved to be leaky beyond repair and had put in at Dartmouth to be mended. After a great deal of expense of lost time, the pair put to sea again but was forced back to Plymouth when the <em>Speedwell </em>sprang more leaks. The ship was clearly unequal to a transatlantic voyage, and some of her passengers boarded the <em>Mayflower </em>while others were forced to stay behind. Half of the provisions had been consumed in the weeks spent dealing with the <em>Speedwell. </em>It had been an inauspicious start to a voyage blessed by the Lord.</p> <p>The <em>Mayflower </em>sped across the white-tipped waves once the voyage was under way, and the passengers were quickly afflicted with seasickness. The crew took great delight in the sufferings of the landlubbers and tormented them mercilessly. "There is an insolent and very profane young man," Bradford wrote, "who was always harassing the poor people in their sickness, and cursing them daily with grievous execrations." He even laughed that he hoped to "throw half of them overboard before they came to their journey's end." The Puritans believed that a just God punished the young sailor for his cruelty when, halfway through the voyage, "it pleased God...to smite the young man with a grievous disease, of which he died in a desperate manner." He was the first to be thrown overboard.</p> <p>The favorable winds dissipated, and the <em>Mayflower </em>encountered a series of fierce storms and westerly gales that forced the crew to furl the sails and ride it out. They were "forced to hull for many days" and driven back. They surrendered to the will of God and prayed for deliverance to survive their arduous journey. One day a young indentured servant came on deck during a terrible storm and was thrown into the sea. He somehow grasped the rope that raised and lowered the topsail even as he was dragged several feet under the surface. He was frantically hauled onto the deck. The Puritans interpreted his rescue as an instance of God's providence rewarding them for their piety. Unlike many other transatlantic voyages, only one passenger died.</p> <p>After a two-month trip during which they suffered the dreadful effects of that common seafaring disease scurvy, land was sighted on November 9. There were some disputes about where they would ultimately land because they tried to head southward for the Hudson River but encountered dangerous shoals and breakers that threatened to wreck the ship. The captain resolved on Cape Cod, but not before "discontented and mutinous speeches" were uttered by some of the "strangers" (passengers who were not Puritans) on board. The strangers were Englishmen who vowed that they were free men and would not submit to any authority over their lives.</p> <p>Given these threatening circumstances to a people plunging into a vast and dangerous wilderness, the Puritans assembled and laid the foundation of their government in the New World. They wrote:</p> <p>In the name of God, Amen. We whose names are underwritten, the loyal subjects of our dread sovereign lord, King James, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, etc., having undertaken for the glory of God, and advancement of the Christian faith, and honor of our king and country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the northern parts of Virginia, do by these presents solemnly and mutually in the presence of God, and of one another, covenant and combine ourselves into a civil body politic, for our better ordering and preservation, and the furtherance of the ends aforesaid and by virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame, such just and equal laws, ordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices, from time to time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the general use of the Colony, unto which we promise all due submission and obedience. In witness thereof we have here underscribed our names as Cape Cod, 11th of November, in the year of the reign of our sovereign lord, King James of England, France, and Ireland the eighteenth, and of Scotland the fifty-fourth.

Focusing primarily on the years after the death of Diana and leading up to the heir to the throne&#x2019;s marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles this past April 9th, royal insider Penny Junor offers a sympathetic yet utterly candid look at a family that has made itself the world&#x2019;s soap opera in THE FIRM: <i>The Troubled Life of the House of Windsor</i>.<br> <br>Can &#x201c;The Firm&#x201d; survive much longer?

The explanation, Junor believes, lies both in the "magic" of the monarchy and in the family's organization into the titular businesslike entity, a phrase coined by Prince Philip. She asserts that the value of the monarchy--during this era without hierarchy, deference and respect--is to act as "a fixture in this morass" of modern life. Junor has met nearly all the royals, as well as many of their associates, and her observations plus long excerpts from interviews give the book an insider feel. This is a favorable, respectful portrait: Junor tempers any criticisms with admiring descriptions of the royals' good deeds, especially their charity work.

HIST Readers of this interesting and occasionally jaw-dropping look at the world's most famous dysfunctional family will find plenty to engage them. Journalist and royal biographer Junor (Charles: Victim or Villain; Diana, Princess of Wales) tells the reader that "the Queen...believes that with few exceptions everything that has gone wrong for the monarchy in the last twenty years has been attributable to Mrs. Parker Bowles." And the reason Prince Harry wore a Nazi uniform to a costume party? "Today's young are blissfully unaware of history (some of them aren't even taught it in our schools)." The reader comes away from the book feeling that had this family ever actually sat down and talked to one another a lot of their very public misfortunes might have been avoided.

And she's fighting for her life in more ways than one: when she's well enough, she'll be taken back to Stockholm to stand trial for a triple murder. With the help of her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, she will have to prove her innocence, and identify and denounce the corrupt politicians who have allowed the vulnerable, like herself, to become victims of abuse and violence. And, on her own, she will plot her revenge&#x2014;against the man who tried to kill her, and the government institutions that very nearly destroyed her life. <p>Once upon a time, she was a victim. Now, Lisbeth Salander is ready to fight back.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010</strong> As the finale to Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, <i>The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest </i>is not content to merely match the adrenaline-charged pace that made international bestsellers out of <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em> and <em>The Girl Who Played with Fire</em>. Instead, it roars with an explosive storyline that blows the doors off the series and announces that the very best has been saved for last. A familiar evil lies in wait for Lisbeth Salander, but this time, she must do more than confront the miscreants of her past; she must destroy them. Much to her chagrin, survival requires her to place a great deal of faith in journalist Mikael Blomkvist and trust his judgment when the stakes are highest. To reveal more of the plot would be criminal, as Larsson's mastery of the unexpected is why millions have fallen hard for his work. But rest assured that the odds are again stacked, the challenges personal, and the action fraught with neck-snapping revelations in this snarling conclusion to a thrilling triad. This closing chapter to The Girl's pursuit of justice is guaranteed to leave readers both satisfied and saddened once the final page has been turned. <em>--Dave Callanan</em><b>Stieg Larsson</b> (1954-2004) was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo from 1999, and had previously worked at a major news agency for many years.

If not totally overlooked in the grand narratives of the Senior Service the lower deck is often only noticed when it is a problem. Seamen are difficult to recruit, sometimes they mutiny on board ship, they are liable to drunkenness and venereal disease, they tend to desert or behave in a feckless manner. For the first time in a dedicated volume The Royal Tars of Old England presents the authentic voice, life and social history of the lower deck - how, in the confines of a fighting ship, the men asserted their independence of authority and, as part of this, established a vivid culture with its own values, language and rituals. The volume conveys the character of the seaman, from the early medieval navy through to the post-Trafalgar long peace, his attitudes to those above him and the navy&#39;s regulations, and the experience of battle as seen from the gun deck or the fighting top.</p><p>Brian Lavery is the guest curator of the exhibition <i>Victory 250</i> at Chatham Historic Dockyard.

The Battle of the Ebro was a vitally important episode in the Spanish conflict and, although ultimately a Republican defeat it proved a severe setback for the Nationalist forces under General Francesco Franco Bahamonde. According to many historians it extended the war for an extra year. Ultimately however it was probably the death knell of the Republic; their armies lost vast amounts of men and materials and they were left incapable of defending their remaining territory effectively.

Such a route would put the needs of Iowa&#x2019;s citizens first and provide transportation for the state&#x2019;s agricultural and industrial trade.&nbsp;<br><br>Analyzing the origins, growth, and eventual dismantling of the Iowa Central Railway, which traversed the state from Ackley to Zearing and Mason City to Marshalltown, Don Hofsommer examines how this unremarkable, &#x201c;plain vanilla&#x201d; railway was an example of the life cycle of the American railroad industry. <i>The Hook &amp; Eye</i> demonstrates its symbiotic relationship with its customers. Born in ambition but never rising far above its obscure origins, the Iowa Central eventually fell to outside competition from railroads based in greater metropolitan areas and was made part of the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway in 1912.&nbsp;<br><br>Drawing the story from station records, annual reports, newspaper articles, and interviews with former employees, <i>The Hook &amp; Eye</i> brings both the industry and human sides of railroading into sharp and memorable view.&nbsp;<br><br>Don L.

By the time he completed his mandate, he had led the country for 14 years, longer than any other French head of state in modern times. Mitterrand mirrored France in all its imperfections and tragedies, its cowardice and glory, its weakness and its strength.</p><p>In the wake of the Observatory affair (in which he orchestrated his own assassination attempt), his secretiveness and mistrust grew more pronounced, especially when details of a second family came to light; he was a mixture of "Machiavelli, Don Corleone, Casanova and the Little Prince," said his doctor.</p><p>During the German occupation, Mitterrand hedged his bets by joining Petain's Vichy government. Later in 1943, under the nom de guerre of Morland (and 30 other aliases), Mitterrand quit Vichy for the Resistance and a paramilitary organization.</p><p>He changed the ground rules of French social and political debate in ways more far-reaching and fundamental than any other modern leader before him, helping set the agenda for France and Europe for generations to come. Philip Short's <i>A Taste for Intrigue</i> will fill the gap and become the standard against which all other Mitterrand biographies are set.</p></p><p><b>Philip Short</b> is the author of several books, among them the definitive biographies <i>Mao: A Life</i> and <i>Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare</i>. He has been a foreign correspondent for <i>The Times</i> (London), <i>The Economist</i>, and the BBC in Uganda, Moscow, China, and Washington, D.C.<p>Prologue</p> <p>Other nations have scandals. The French have affairs.</p> <p>From the Dreyfus Affair, before the Great War, when the country was at loggerheads with itself over the supposed treason of a Jewish officer; to the Stavisky Affair in the 1930s, in which a politically well-connected embezzler &#x2018;committed suicide with a bullet which someone fired at him at point-blank range&#x2019;, as one newspaper gleefully put it, bringing down the government of the day; the Bazooka Affair in the 1950s, when Michel Debr�, a close aide to France&#x2019;s wartime leader, General Charles de Gaulle, was suspected of complicity in the attempted murder of the French army commander in Algeria; the Affair of Bokassa&#x2019;s Diamonds, in the 1970s, which helped end the re-election hopes of President Val�ry Giscard d&#x2019;Estaing; and the Clearstream Affair, twenty years later, when another French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, threatened to hang a rival &#x2018;from a butcher&#x2019;s hook&#x2019;, affairs have punctuated the rhythms of French political life.</p> <p>They are never fully elucidated, never satisfactorily explained, and leave an odour of malfeasance which continues to haunt the protagonists for the rest of their political careers.</p> <p>Few affairs in modern French history have been as enduring and insidious as the Observatory Affair, so called because it took place near the gardens of that name in the Latin Quarter of Paris. That year, 1959, the Algerian war of independence was raging. De Gaulle had been called out of retirement by French army commanders who, infuriated by the reluctance of the civilian government to crack down decisively on a rebellion in what was then still officially part of metropolitan France, had threatened a <i>coup d&#x2019;�tat</i>. He had been given emergency powers and, the previous September, a new constitution had been approved, enshrining presidential rule. The Fourth Republic, with its fragile and ephemeral parliamentary governments, was gone. France found itself catapulted into a new era of republican monarchy.</p> <p>Among the few mainstream politicians who had voted against de Gaulle&#x2019;s return was Fran�ois Mitterrand, then among the leaders of the non-communist opposition. Mitterrand was not exactly a rising star, having held government office a dozen times since 1944, when he had become the youngest French minister since the Second Empire of Napoleon III, almost a century earlier. A gifted orator, his devastating put-downs, deceptively casual and often slightly tongue in cheek, masked an innate shyness which he went to great lengths to conceal.</p> <p>Until de Gaulle&#x2019;s recall, Mitterrand had been regarded, not least by himself, as a Prime Minister in waiting. Subsequently he had been marginalised as the fault line in French politics shifted. Instead of dividing Left from Right, it now separated those who wanted negotiations in Algeria from those who favoured a military solution. To diehard conservatives, who had championed the General&#x2019;s return but had afterwards come to distrust his intentions, Mitterrand epitomised the decadence of the weak civilian leaderships which had sold out French Indochina and seemed to be preparing to do the same in the one imperial stronghold France had left: North Africa. His opponents attacked him as &#x2018;anti-national&#x2019;, parliamentary language for a traitor.</p> <p>That autumn, Paris was alive with rumours of right-wing assassination squads being sent from Algiers by extremist settler organisations to execute political moderates. Louis Mermaz, later Speaker of the National Assembly, remembered it as &#x2018;a sulphurous time, threats flying in all directions&#x2019;. Albin Chalandon, the Gaullist party Secretary-General, spoke of a plot to overthrow the government. Certain politicians, who were judged to be particularly vulnerable, including the former Prime Minister, Pierre Mend�s France, were given round-the-clock police protection. In October, one of Mitterrand&#x2019;s closest friends informed him that death lists were circulating in Oran, Algeria&#x2019;s second city: &#x2018;Mitterrand&#x2019;s name was listed first and Michelet (the Gaullist Justice Minister) second&#x2019;. In the summer, plastic explosives were placed outside the door of his apartment but failed to detonate. His wife, Danielle, at home alone with two young children, started getting telephone calls late at night. &#x2018;A voice would say, &#x201c;Does black suit you? I hope so because soon you will wear it for your husband.&#x201d; I told Fran�ois, but he wouldn&#x2019;t take it seriously. He said it was just cranks.&#x2019;</p> <p>Nevertheless, on October 14, Mitterrand asked a trusted friend, Bernard Finifter, to find him a bulletproof jacket. Finifter approached the Director of National Security at the Interior Ministry, Jean Verdier. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s a matter of life and death,&#x2019; he pleaded. But he refused to explain why he wanted it and Verdier turned him down.</p> <p>The following day, a Thursday, brought more ominous developments.</p> <p>The right-wing evening newspaper, <i>Paris-Presse</i>, led its front page with a melodramatic warning: &#x2018;A tragedy is in the making .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It could be for tomorrow. Already groups of killers have crossed the border from Spain. Those to be executed have been chosen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. 18 months after [de Gaulle&#x2019;s return to power], we risk seeing the outbreak of a fratricidal internal conflict.&#x2019; It had been written by a prominent Gaullist MP, who said later that his information had come from two concordant sources in Algeria and that the head of the French counter-espionage service, the DST, had confirmed it.</p> <p>Mitterrand dined at home that night with Danielle and a group of friends. Afterwards with three companions, he drove to the Champs-Elys�es, the great thoroughfare that points like an arrow into the heart of Paris, descending from the Arc de Triomphe to the Tuileries Gardens and the Louvre. They bought <i>Paris-Presse</i> at a news-stand and stopped at a caf�, the <i>Pam Pam</i>, to discuss the story over a drink. &#x2018;It seems things are coming to a head,&#x2019; Mitterrand murmured. At his suggestion they drove back to St Germain des Pr�s on the Left Bank, not far from his home, to have a nightcap at the Brasserie Lipp.</p> <p>Lipp was, and remains today, a Parisian institution, a meeting place&nbsp;for politicians, philosophers, actresses and bishops, writers and celebrities, from Hemingway and Jean-Paul Sartre to Verlaine and Chagall. Its wood-panelled fa�ade, belle �poque floral ceramics, painted Veronese-style ceilings, and mirrors subtly tilted so that its habitu�s can both see and be seen, have witnessed more than a century of copious Alsatian cuisine, foaming jugs of beer (of which Marcel Proust, when not nibbling madeleines, was said to have been a devotee), flirtatious dalliances and political and literary intrigues.</p> <p>Mitterrand was a regular. But on this occasion, after greeting a few acquaintances, he told his companions he felt tired and left. Within minutes, he said later, he sensed that he was being followed. Two men in a light green Renault Dauphine kept steadily behind his car. To be sure that his imagination was not playing tricks, he changed his usual route, turning left at the Senate to drive down the eastern side of the Luxembourg Gardens, past the rise that leads to the Pantheon, then southward towards the Observatory, founded in 1667 by the Sun King, Louis XIV. Whenever he slowed down, the Renault did the same.</p> <p>Abruptly I turned right into the rue Auguste Comte, accelerating as I did so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The other car did the same and started gaining on me. It would be hard for me to explain what was going through my head at that moment, but I knew that whatever happened I had to escape my pursuers. I was familiar with the area and instinctively I veered across the road, jamming on the brakes and coming to a halt between two parked cars. I literally flew out of my seat, raced towards the [Observatory] gardens and jumped the fence, throwing myself face-down in a flower-bed. A volley of shots rang out .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Then I saw them drive off .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had the impression that they gave up trying to kill me when they saw me jump out and run. They shot up the empty car in order to be able to say to their bosses, &#x2018;We did it. But there were unforeseen circumstances.&#x2019;</p> <p>Mitterrand&#x2019;s car, a blue Peugeot saloon, had seven bullet holes, which the police established had been fired from a Sten gun.</p> <p>When he finally got back to his apartment, long after midnight, Danielle found him &#x2018;shattered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He was always reserved &#x2013; not the kind of man to throw himself into his wife&#x2019;s arms, announcing &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve just escaped death!&#x201d; .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But that night he was completely closed in on himself. I couldn&#x2019;t even talk to him. He just stayed in his room.&#x2019;</p> <p>Expressions of sympathy poured in from all sides. To many it was a sign that the <i>ultras</i>, as the diehard nationalists were called, were losing patience with de Gaulle&#x2019;s regime. Mitterrand had been targeted not because of his liberal views but as a shot across the bows of the government, a warning to the administration that the French settlers in Algeria and their extremist leaders would not sit idly by if the authorities tried to abandon them.</p> <p>A week later came the <i>coup de th��tre.</i></p> <p>On October 22, a former MP named Robert Pesquet, who had represented an extreme right-wing party in parliament until the year before, informed the investigating magistrate that the assassination attempt had been faked.</p> <p>Mitterrand, he said, had approached him earlier that month with a proposal that he simulate an attack &#x2018;in order to provoke the destruction of the <i>ultras</i> and their organisations&#x2019;. In return, Mitterrand had promised to help him relaunch his political career. Pesquet said he had played along with the subterfuge because, as a supporter of French rule in Algeria, he wanted to expose Mitterrand as a liar in order to discredit him, and all those like him, who favoured negotiating with the rebels. He had staged the shooting himself with an accomplice, he added, but in such a way as to ensure that nobody would be hurt.</p> <p>Summoned by the magistrate to explain himself, Mitterrand denied everything. He said he had encountered Pesquet by chance two weeks earlier and the latter had repeatedly telephoned, asking to see him again. When eventually he agreed to a meeting, on October 14, Pesquet told him that he was linked to a terrorist group which had put Mitterrand on a blacklist to be killed. The former MP had sworn him to secrecy, saying that if his associates learnt that he had betrayed them his own life and the lives of his family would be in danger. He had come to warn Mitterrand, he added, because, whatever their differences about Algeria, he wanted no part in murder. The following afternoon, Mitterrand told the magistrate, Pesquet had contacted him again to tell him the attack was imminent and promising that if he had more information, he would wait for Mitterrand at Lipp that night. But there had been no sign of Pesquet at the brasserie and the next thing he knew his car was being followed.</p> <p>To the magistrate&#x2019;s inevitable question, &#x2018;Why didn&#x2019;t you go to the police?&#x2019;, Mitterrand replied that he had given his word and did not intend to break it.*</p> <p>There matters might have rested. Pesquet had a history of shady deals that had caused him earlier brushes with the law. Mitterrand kept repeating to his friends, &#x2018;It&#x2019;s his word against mine.&#x2019;</p> <p>But Pesquet had been cunning.</p> <p>Six hours <i>before</i> the attack, he had sent a letter to himself at a poste restante address describing in detail what was to happen. A bailiff accompanied him when he collected it and attested to the time on the postmark. For the press and for public opinion, it followed that Pesquet must be telling the truth. The only possible explanation was that he and Mitterrand had concocted the whole thing together. Overnight, from having been a hero, Mitterrand became a bad joke; at best a na�ve dupe, at worst an incompetent trickster whose machinations had come unstuck, deserving, as one newspaper put it, &#x2018;not hate, but a certain contempt&#x2019;.</p> <p>The trap, for trap it was, had been diabolically set.</p> <p>Mitterrand in the late 1950s was a savvy, seasoned politician with a national reputation. A serial seducer, with countless conquests to his name, a mark in France not of inconstancy but of virility and savoir-faire, he was controversial, charismatic and secretive. That he could have been bamboozled by an adventurer like Pesquet seemed totally out of character. Andr� Bettencourt, who had known him since they were students together, was quoted in the press describing his &#x2018;instinctive distrustfulness and sang-froid&#x2019;. Mitterrand normally weighed to a nicety the pros and cons of every step he took. Yet he had walked blindly into an ambush which even a neophyte should have seen.</p> <p>Andr� Rousselet, a long-time member of Mitterrand&#x2019;s inner circle, felt that in the days after Pesquet&#x2019;s revelations, he was close to suicide. Fran�ois Dalle, a friend since the 1930s, thought the same: &#x2018;for a week I spent every day with him, because I wanted to avoid a disaster&#x2019;. Georges Beauchamp, a colleague from the Resistance, feared a repeat of the Salengro Affair, when, in 1936, a minister in the Popular Front government had killed himself after a campaign of calumny. &#x2018;Salengro was on all our minds,&#x2019; said Roland Dumas, later French Foreign Minister. &#x2018;With hindsight, I don&#x2019;t think he would have done it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But back then I wasn&#x2019;t so sure.&#x2019;</p> <p>Mitterrand believed that his career was finished and that he would never recover. &#x2018;He was convinced of it,&#x2019; a colleague recalled. &#x2018;I remember going out for a walk with him. He thought it was all over.&#x2019; That weekend was his forty-third birthday. Danielle, for the first time since their marriage, saw him weakened. &#x2018;I discovered that he was human that day. He was staring into an abyss. For nights on end he paced up and down in the apartment, trying to figure out what to do. It became an obsession.&#x2019; Years later he spoke of feeling &#x2018;as though I were at the bottom of a well&#x2019;.</p> <p>Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, who edited the progressive weekly, <i>l&#x2019;Express</i>, remembered a meeting in his office where Mitterrand, normally the most private and unemotional of men, &#x2018;broke down and cried like a baby&#x2019;. With a handful of exceptions, Servan-Schreiber among them, his political friends abandoned him. Even Henri Frenay, a wartime Gaullist minister who was godfather to Mitterrand&#x2019;s son, Gilbert, told Danielle when she sought his help that he &#x2018;didn&#x2019;t want to get involved&#x2019;.</p> <p>Salvation, of a kind, came in November, when it was disclosed that, during the summer, Pesquet had approached Maurice Bourg�s-Maunoury, a Centre-Right leader and former Prime Minister whose views on Algeria were more conservative than Mitterrand&#x2019;s, with a similar claim that he was to be targeted for assassination. Bourg�s, two years older and a more down-to-earth, phlegmatic character, had wisely refused to have anything to do with him. De Gaulle&#x2019;s government had known this for weeks but had kept quiet so as to cause Mitterrand the maximum political damage.</p> <p>The disclosure fatally undermined his opponents&#x2019; case against him. If Pesquet had tried earlier to ensnare others, Mitterrand could no longer be accused of having initiated the plot himself. Like a souffl� that collapses once the hot air inside cools, the Observatory Affair began to look like the political silliness it was. Who after all could seriously believe that Mitterrand would turn to a virtual unknown, a political opponent to boot, to simulate an attempt on his life, in which real bullets would be used, at the risk of getting himself killed?&#x2020; Ha...</p></p><h2>Death Taxes and Other Illusions</h2><p>Book by Patent, Arnold M.</p><p></p><h2>The City and the Stars</h2><p>Men had built cities before, but never such a city as Diaspar; for millennia its protective dome shutout the creeping decay and danger of the world outside.

It is the author's hope that the deeper understanding of Chinese medicine gained from appreciation of the formulas' origins and evolution will help practitioners successfully treat the complex and varied patterns that present in their practices. <p> The introduction includes both a section on how to prescribe and dose herb concentrates, and a section that describes the production of herb concentrates. The main formula section of the text presents functions, indications, and ingredients for almost 300 formulas (arranged alphabetically according to pinyin name), and includes textbook-style discussion and modification sections. Each formula discussion focuses on how the formula is used in the clinic, based on the evolution of its use from the time of its source text to the present. The discussion and modifications sections include both classical and modern uses, and seek to show the relationship between the two. Where relevant, the formula under discussion is compared with similar formulas, and guidelines for determining the correct formula for a given situation are provided. The material in the discussion and modifications sections is drawn from the author's experience, the experience of the practitioners with whom he has studied, the source texts (when available to the author), and commentaries by modern authors.</p></p><p>Andrew Ellis first studied Chinese medicine with Dr. James Tin Yau So at the New England School of Acupuncture.

Balance...a simple concept, yet something that is missing in the customer service and leadership approaches used in many organizations today. <p>Join Doug, the former head of training at Disney University, on a journey to assess your service and leadership approach. Blend some "back stage" secrets of Disney with a dose of Eastern philosophy, then mix in a number of strategies than can be immediately applied in the workplace and you have the essence of Monkeys. This book is designed to be a practical tool to help you analyze the service and products you or your organization provide from the standpoint of being in balance. How well are you attending to both the "art" and "science" needs of your employees and customers? If not taking care of both, you are losing valuable customers and employees. Eleven exercises, that have been adopted by world-class organizations, are included to help you determine: </p><p>�Your individual and organizational strengths <br>�Where you need to make improvements <br>�Specific action steps to maximize your strengths and minimize your weaknesses. </p><p>The result is a blueprint to attain and maintain your service and leadership balance!</p></p><p>"Even Monkeys Fall From Trees" is an old Japanese proverb I particularly like. It means that regardless of how capable or skilled anyone is, sooner or later, we all lose our balance and make mistakes. We know monkeys don't fall from trees, but everyone has seen remarkably capable people and successful companies make mistakes &#x2013; in other words, fall from their trees. Consider when you, your team or company has "fallen from the tree". Were you willing to own up to your own responsibility for making the mistake or not? If so, pat yourself on the back for taking a key step in remedying in the problem. Unfortunately, some companies and individuals refuse to take responsibility for their failings, preferring to blame the customer or market for their decline in profits or market share. But that&#x2019;s like blaming the weak branch on the tree for a fall. <p>Monkeys takes the concept of learning from our successes and mistakes &#x2013; the concept of keeping your balance on the tree -- and applies it to customer service. And, references to customers include not only your external customers, who buy your goods or services, but your internal customers as well, including your co-workers, managers, and subordinates. So, Monkeys addresses the topics of leadership and teamwork, as well. </p><p>Whether you are an executive heading up a company or a front-line employee, reading the book and doing the exercises will help you assess your current approach, so you can identify areas of strength and areas for improvement.</p>Doug Lipp, MA, an internationally acclaimed expert on customer service, leadership and global competitiveness, motivates and challenges audiences around the world as a consultant and speaker.

Donaldson, has created a shining example that proves his gift as a master storyteller. It is the story of Terisa Morgan and Geraden, son of the Domme, set in the strange land called Mordant. It is a rich and finely textured novel of love and lust, power and court politics, in a place where nothing is ever what it seems....</p><p><b>Stephen R. Donaldson</b>&nbsp;is the bestselling author of the series The Gap Cycle, Mordant's Need, and the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever, including <i>Lord Foul's Bane </i>and&nbsp;<i>The Second Chronicles of Thomas Covenant</i>;&nbsp;and other works, such as&nbsp;<i>Daughter of Regals and Other Tales </i>and a mystery series under the pseudonym Reed Stephens. He is the recipient of the first prize of the British Science Fiction Society and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award.As a followup to his bestselling Thomas Covenant trilogies, Donaldson presents another lengthy, dense fantasy adventure in the first of the two-book sequence Mordant's Need. This first volume introduces the land of Mordant, beset from without by armies and monsters and from within by plots, dissension and madness. The search for a champion goes awry as the Congery of Imagers first lures poor little rich girl Terisa Morgan from our world, and then snatches a mysterious warrior whose futuristic weapons destroy part of the castle he is supposed to defend. Terisa rises to the challenge, quickly becoming a key figure, a wild card among the many cliques and powers vying to save or seize king and kingdom. Donaldson scores with the magic discipline of imagery, in which mirrors serve as windows on alternate worlds. His characterization, however, is either derivative or programmatic (in a world without ordinary mirrors, no one can be taken at face value). Readers are likely to be hooked by the interlocking intrigues and progressive revelations among a large cast in a vast old castle riddled with secret passageshooked, but probably disappointed, for this overlong volume is all buildup for the second. 200,000 first printing; $200,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dream of the Marsh Wren: Writing As Reciprocal Creation (Credo)</h2><p>A poet, a mother, a lover of the land, and a student of zoology, Pattiann Rogers is at home in the vocabulary of nature. The Dream of the Marsh Wren reveals the genesis of some of her most admired poems as well as her conception of how and why she writes.</p><p>paper 1-57131-220-5 Rogers (Eating Bread and Honey, not reviewed, etc.) seeks to situate, in plain words, the genesis of her poetry, an experience she handles with aplomb even while it lays her open. In this investigation into what it means to write, one of Milkweed's new Credo series's statements of belief, Rogers speaks of origins and sensations rather than process, which, after the form has been decided upon, is a matter of feeling her way forward with language. Her first poem grew out of a longing for and identification with autumn in the hills and woods of the Ozarks; the very act of writing about it brought her comfort and joy. It was also a ``power of my own creation to enter and alter my soul. The language had created me,'' a generative reciprocity that swung into perpetual motion for her. Much of Rogers's poetry has fixed on natural history and notions of place, giving praise to creature and landscape, deciphering how she will act honorably with them without sermonizing or sanitizing: ``that stain / of stinkhorn down your front, / that leaking roil of bracket / fungi down your back.'' The shape of a tree can possess a place for her and chart the architecture of her words; a way of seeing is hatched, where the tree ``responds to and encourages and itself takes sustenance from such human bonds.'' And these explorations into parts unknown necessarily stop at eerie stations: ``After her traditional repertoire she always plays / One piece on her violin in a register so high / The music can't be heard.'' Rogers can stumble, too, with pointless comments or not using her skillful economy in her prose, smothering the three lovely words ``hurting summer heat'' by following with ``a heavy, moist, fiery, unrelieved encumbrance.'' These are rare lapses. When a poet spills her secrets, that's a special gift. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Sparking the idea for this book was Carroll&#x2019;s visit to the spot where Abraham Lincoln&#x2019;s son was saved by the brother of Lincoln&#x2019;s assassin. Carroll wondered, <i>How many other</i> <i>unmarked places are there where intriguing events have unfolded and that we walk past every day, not realizing their significance?</i> To answer that question, Carroll ultimately trekked to every region of the country -- by car, train, plane, helicopter, bus, bike, and kayak and on foot.

Love that. So let me ask: If they&#x2019;re forgotten and unmarked, how did you locate them?</p> <p><strong>ANDREW: </strong> I&#x2019;m constantly reading a ton of books and newspapers, and I subscribe to about thirty magazines&#x2014;</p> <p><strong>BM: </strong> <i>Thirty?</i></p> <p><strong>AC: </strong> Maybe more, and on a wide range of topics&#x2014;travel, archaeology, current events, science, history, you name it&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m always on the lookout for great, little-known stories. When I stumble onto one, I trace it back to a relevant physical spot to see if it&#x2019;s unmarked. For example, when I read that television was essentially invented by a fourteen-year-old farm boy named Philo Farnsworth in Rigby, Idaho, I immediately began searching for the farm where he had his epiphany. Sure enough, there was no plaque or marker there, and it became one of the locations I wrote about.</p> <p><strong>BM: </strong> You mention in <i>Here Is Where</i> that you hated history growing up. Shame, shame. And what changed your mind?</p> <p><strong>AC: </strong> I know, it&#x2019;s terrible. But I was very intimidated by history at first. I&#x2019;m horrible at memorizing things, and I just couldn&#x2019;t remember all those names and dates in my high school textbooks. Then, during my sophomore year of college, our family&#x2019;s house burned down, and almost everything we had was destroyed. Losing all our memorabilia inspired my passion for preserving letters, and eventually, a general love for history. Whether it&#x2019;s the war letters books I edited [<i>War Letters</i> and <i>Behind the Lines</i>], which featured previously unpublished correspondence, or <i>Here Is Where</i>, I try to write for both history buffs who want to learn something new and surprising, and for those who are a bit daunted by the subject, as I once was. It&#x2019;s been especially gratifying to hear from teachers who&#x2019;ve used the idea behind <i>Here Is Where</i> to encourage their students to seek out unmarked sites in their communities&#x2014;and, sometimes, literally in their own backyards.</p> <p><strong>BM: </strong> I know you also went to almost every state in the U.S. Do you consider <i>Here Is Where</i> more of a history book or a travel book?</p> <p><strong>AC: </strong> I think both. It&#x2019;s definitely about exploring this country as if for the first time, and I wanted to convey the sense of exhilaration and discovery that I experienced. Writing about the journey enabled me to reveal how I found the various sites, and I met so many fascinating people that I wanted to relate some of the more memorable encounters I had along the way. Also, because I spent so much time walking around these different towns and cities, I dropped, like, ten pounds. So I guess we could market <i>Here Is Where</i> as a weight-loss book, too.</p> <p><strong>BM: </strong> Speaking of &#x201c;memorable encounters,&#x201d; you had several brushes with law enforcement.</p> <p><strong>AC: </strong> I did, and I&#x2019;m shocked I wasn&#x2019;t arrested. But one of my run-ins did lead to a good story. I was speeding through a rural area of Missouri and got pulled over by a state trooper. I had sort of zoned out and wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to how fast I was going, which is pretty much what I told the officer, and he, understandably, was furious. After giving me a ticket, he sternly instructed me to use my cruise control, and, honest to God, this prompted me to scribble on the ticket: &#x201c;Cruise control inventor?&#x201d; I did some research and discovered that, incredibly, the guy who invented cruise control, Ralph Teetor, was totally blind. Thanks to his daughter, I was able to locate their old house in Hagerstown, Indiana, where Teetor created the prototype in the late 1950s.</p> <p><strong>BM: </strong> You write in the book&#x2019;s introduction that your cross-country trip had to be more than a &#x201c;grand sightseeing adventure&#x201d; and that you hoped to explore &#x201c;why any of this&#x201d;&#x2014;meaning, history&#x2014;&#x201c;matters.&#x201d; What are some of the lessons you want readers to take away from the book?</p> <p><strong>AC: </strong> That&#x2019;s a hard question to answer succinctly. There&#x2019;s no question that history shows us patterns of human behavior over time and can serve as both a warning, cautioning us to beware of our capacity for violence and destruction, and an inspiration, reminding us our more admirable qualities like courage, resilience, and selflessness. But most of all I wanted to express how a love for history can influence the way we live our lives on a more day-to-day basis. At its best, history shows how interconnected we are and, ideally, can nurture within us a sense of humility and gratitude. It helps us remember the sacrifices made by those who&#x2019;ve come before us and how much we&#x2019;ve benefited from them&#x2014;whether they&#x2019;re medical pioneers, inventors, veterans, or activists&#x2014;in ways we often take for granted. There&#x2019;s a quote I keep in my wallet by the author Lewis Thomas that reads: &#x201c;Statistically, the probability of any one of us being here is so small that you&#x2019;d think the mere fact of existing would keep us all in a contented dazzlement of surprise.&#x201d; Dr. Thomas was a scientist, not a historian, but I think his quote perfectly captures what <i>Here Is Where</i>, ultimately, is all about.</p><p>ANDREW CARROLL is best known for creating the Legacy Project, which archives wartime correspondence, and <i>War Letters, </i>which sold more than 300,000 copies and inspired an acclaimed PBS documentary.&nbsp; Other <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers include <i>Letters of a Nation </i>and <i>Behind the Lines. </i>Carroll&#x2019;s <i>Operation Homecoming </i>inspired an Emmy-winning documentary.&nbsp; He lives in Washington, D.C.

Before he drove from the reserve in his shiny black limousine, Borys Demyanovich Krajnik, who was the senior manager, ordered Maxim Borisovich Melnik--who looked after all the animals on the nature reserve--to run away, too.<br><br> &#x201c;The Germans are coming,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told Max. &#x201c;Their armies have attacked and invaded the Soviet Union without warning. They&#x2019;ve already taken the great city of Kiev and they will be here soon. Perhaps as early as next week.&#x201d;<br><br> Krajnik was emptying his desk and packing his bags while he was speaking to Maxim Borisovich Melnik and seemed to be preparing to leave.<br><br> &#x201c;But I thought the Germans were our allies,&#x201d; said Max, for much had changed in Ukraine since 1919.<br><br> &#x201c;They were, that&#x2019;s true. But now they&#x2019;re not, see? That&#x2019;s just politics. Doubtless they&#x2019;re after the oil fields of the Crimea. For their war machine. Look, Maxim Borisovich, all you need to know now is that the Germans are fascists and when they get here, they will kill you. Of course, in time our own Red Army will defeat them, but until this happens, you should definitely leave the reserve.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But where shall I go?&#x201d; Max asked Krajnik.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your problem, Comrade. But my advice is to go east, toward our own forces. Go east as quickly as you can. However, before you can leave, there&#x2019;s an important order I&#x2019;m giving to you. Very important. It comes from the central committee.&#x201d;<br><br> Max was astounded that the central committee of the Communist Party even knew he still existed, let alone that they had given him an important order. He couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at the very idea of this.<br><br> &#x201c;An order for me? What is it, Comrade?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The committee orders you to slaughter all of the animals on the reserve.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, Borys Demyanovich. Or perhaps the committee is joking.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The central committee doesn&#x2019;t make jokes, Maxim Borisovich.&#x201d;<br><br> The smile disappeared from Max&#x2019;s old bearded face as quickly as it had arrived. He rubbed his neck thoughtfully; it always seemed to hurt a little when the subject of killing an animal came up.<br><br> &#x201c;Kill all our animals, you say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All of them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What--the zebras? The ostriches? The llamas?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Comrade.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Including the Przewalski&#x2019;s horses?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Including the horses.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For goodness&#x2019; sake, why?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To stop them from falling into enemy hands, of course. There&#x2019;s enough meat walking around this reserve to feed a small army. Deer, goats, bison, horses, chickens--they&#x2019;re all to be shot. I&#x2019;d help you myself but, er . . . I&#x2019;ve some important orders of my own. I&#x2019;m urgently required in Kharkov. So I have to leave today. Now. As soon as I&#x2019;ve finished talking to you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I couldn&#x2019;t kill our animals, Comrade,&#x201d; said Max. &#x201c;Some of them are very rare. So rare, their species might even become extinct. Not only that, but some of them are my friends.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sentimental nonsense. We&#x2019;re fighting a war, d&#x2019;you understand? And our people are the ones who are facing extinction. The Germans mean to take our land and destroy all of us so that they can live on it. So, if I come back and find that you haven&#x2019;t carried out my orders, I&#x2019;ll call the secret police and have you shot. You&#x2019;ve got a rifle. Now use it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; said Max, although obviously he had no intention of killing any of the animals; besides, he rather doubted that Borys Demyanovich Krajnik was coming back anytime soon. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it, but I&#x2019;ll do as you say, Comrade.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it any more than you, Maxim Borisovich, but this is a patriotic war we&#x2019;re fighting. We&#x2019;re fighting for our very survival. It&#x2019;s the Germans or us. From what I hear, they&#x2019;ve already done some terrible things in Poland. So you would do well to be afraid of them.&#x201d;<br><br> And with those words, Krajnik drove away, as quickly as he could.<br><br> Max went outside the house and walked back to his simple cottage on the edge of the steppe.<br><br> The reserve of which he now had full charge was a hidden, enchanted place that consisted of a zoological park and an open territory of steppe covering more than three hundred square kilometers. A wild, desolate-looking region, it is mostly open grassland and largely treeless except for pockets of dense forest growing near rivers and lakes. The steppe is famous for being as bare as the palm of a man&#x2019;s hand, where there abides but rain and cold in winter and baking sun in summer, but in truth, the weather is more unpredictable than that.<br><br> Max did not think he would miss Krajnik very much. One of the reasons the old man was so fond of the reserve was that people like Krajnik were seldom encountered: there were just six small villages in the reserve and the nearest city, Mykolaiv, was more than three hours&#x2019; drive away. Max thought that was just as well, since the whole idea of a nature reserve is to provide a sanctuary from men, where animals can exist without being put to work or hunted for food. In spite of what Krajnik had said about the Germans, the old man had high hopes of them being a real improvement on the Ukrainian Soviet government. And he did not think this hope was unreasonable.<br><br> For one thing, it was a German, not a Ukrainian or a Russian, who had loved animals enough to create the sanctuary at Askaniya-Nova. That same German--the baron Falz-Fein--had been the only man ever to show Max any real kindness. Everything he remembered about the Germans at Askaniya-Nova persuaded Max that if they did turn up and try to kill the animals, he could reason with them. After all, he could speak German, although it had been many years since he&#x2019;d needed to. And so the first thing he did when Krajnik departed from Askaniya-Nova was not to shoot any of the animals but to return to his cottage and look for the German dictionary and grammar book that the baron had given him on his birthday more than forty years ago. And since he had only one small bookshelf with the Bible, a long poem called Eugene Onegin and The Game of Chess by Savielly Tartakower, Max quickly found these books and started to reacquaint himself with the complexities of the German language.<br><br> It was another two weeks before the German SS arrived in trucks and on motorbikes, and took over the main house. They seemed to be in a very good mood and behaved with courtesy when Max presented himself to some of the guards and asked to see the officer in charge. Despite the pirate skull and crossbones on their hats and helmets, they weren&#x2019;t at all frightening to Max. They ushered him into the baron&#x2019;s old study, where he snatched off his cap and introduced himself to a Captain Grenzmann.

Labeling forgery the "criminal sibling" of criticism, he describes a panorama of remarkable individuals--forgers, from classical Greece through the recent past, who produced a variety of splendid triumphs of learning and style, and scholarly detectives, who honed the tools of scholarship in attempts to unmask these skillful fakers. In the process he discloses the extent, the coherence, and the historical interest of two significant and tightly intertwined strands in the Western intellectual tradition. "The desire to forge," writes the author, "can bite and infect almost anyone: . . . the honest as well as the rogue." Forgers are inspired not only by ambition or greed but also by impulses to play jokes, exuberant desires to see the past made whole again, or serious wishes to invoke divine or distantly historical authority for particular spiritual or national traditions. Whatever their goals, forgers in classical antiquity as well as in the modern era have often been well ahead of critics in the pursuit of methods of authenticating documents, and Grafton shows that many techniques normally considered the invention of scholars in early modern Europe were already employed in classical times. This accessible work discusses forgers as different from each other as Dionysus the "Renegade," Erasmus, Carlo Sigonio, James Macpherson ("Ossian"), Thomas Chatterton, and the great sixteenth-century Dominican scholar Giovanni Nanni (Annius) of Viterbo, whose forged histories by Berosus, Manetho, and other ancient authors drove the real histories of the ancient world from the literary marketplace for almost a hundred years. One chapter is devoted to comparing three scholars--Porphyry (third century), Isaac Casaubon (1559-1614), and Richard Reitzenstein (1861-1931)--whose efforts to deal with the same body of forged material, the Hermetica, reveal both continuity and change in critical method. What emerges from Forgers and Critics is a new appreciation for a strange literary genre that has flourished for over 2500 years--amusing its uninvolved observers, enraging its humiliated victims, and, most importantly, contributing to a richer sense of what the past was really like.</p><br></p><p>"Grafton makes clear that the master forger must also be ... a scholar ... as knowledgeable as those whom he is trying to fool.... This elegant monograph ranges from Porphyry through Isaac Casaubon ... on to Scaliger, Chatterton and others, though its focus remains the transmission of classical texts. Or, rather, pseudo-classical texts."<b>--<i>Washington Post</i><br> </b><br></p><h2>Mexican Wilderness and Wildlife</h2><p>Ben Tinker spent years exploring the rugged wilderness of the Sierra Madres and the vast deserts of Sonora and Baja California; Mexican Wilderness and Wildlife condenses a lifetime of outdoor lore and learning.</p><p>Ben Tinker was a rancher, wildlife journalist, hunter, and fly fisherman.

Over a career spanning the decades since 1954&#x2019;s Monster from the Ocean Floor, Corman has produced or directed nearly 500 movies. Gifted with an almost psychic ability to read the minds of the moviegoing public, from the days of the drive-in and the teenage double-bill through the biker movies of the &#x2019;60s, the women-in-prison movies of the &#x2019;70s, the direct-to-video action-exploitation salad days of the &#x2019;80s and &#x2019;90s, and the sf cult sensation Dinocroc vs. Supergator, he&#x2019;s anticipated numerous trends as well as launched a few. In the process, he&#x2019;s nurtured or boosted the careers of countless luminaries such as Ron Howard, Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, Sylvester Stallone, and Pam Grier. Nashawaty interweaves interviews from these and other graduates of the Roger Corman School of Filmmaking to create an engrossing oral history.

In fact, much of her life is shrouded in mystery. Putting aside Cecily&#x2019;s role as mother and wife, who was she really?<br><br>Matriarch of the York dynasty, she navigated through a tumultuous period and lived to see the birth of the future Henry VIII. From seeing the house of York defeat their Lancastrian cousins; to witnessing the defeat of her own son, Richard III, at the battle of Bosworth, Cecily then saw one of her granddaughters become Henry VII&#x2019;s queen consort.<br><br>Her story is full of controversy and the few published books on her life are full of guess-work.

Mrs. Heath, librarian at Happyland Elementary School, receives a DVD and letter from her students while she is on maternity leave. The letter notes that they miss her, and that the substitute falls asleep and snores while reading in the rocker. Meanwhile the pages are "helping" to keep the library running smoothly. Each scene horrifies Mrs. Heath more as the children describe putting all the thin books together, shelving the books by color, mending them with attractively colored duct tape, cutting pictures out of encyclopedias for collages, shelving every third book with the pages pointing out, borrowing books without checking them out&#x2013;the list goes on and on. Just as the mortified Mrs. Heath is ready to call the school, the kids pop on the screen and yell "April Fool!" Docampo's colorful combination of manual and digital illustrations sets a perfectly mood for this story. This is an entertaining read-aloud, a humorous joke, and an excellent starter for library orientation.<i>Debbie Whitbeck, West Ottawa Public Schools, Holland, MI</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

Beyond that, I know practically nothing about his final hours on this earth. All I have is the odd scrap of information and the patchy impressions of the bystanders, and it&#x2019;s like I&#x2019;m at the theater, looking at the stage and seeing only the supporting cast, the scenery and the arrangement of shadows. All the important elements are missing. There are no principal actors, no stage directions and no script.<br><br> The receptionist said this&#x2014;that Felix&#x2019;s last morning was fresh and cold, that there was a frost on the lawn outside the hotel and a mist in the distance, where the woods are. She&#x2019;d watched Felix sprinting out of the hotel, down the gravel drive, then turning left at the gate. &#x201c;I was arriving for work and I called out &#x2018;good morning!&#x2019; &#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But he didn&#x2019;t reply; he just kept running.&#x201d;<br><br> Forty minutes later, he was back, dropping his head to catch his breath, panting and sweating. He straightened up and, now noticing the receptionist, said that he&#x2019;d sprinted all the way to the golf course, running the perimeter and the long path through the woods back to the hotel. He thought that the sun glancing through the trees had been magical, as though life was just beginning (how extraordinary that he should say such a thing!). Then he took the stairs up to his room, two at a time.<br><br> He didn&#x2019;t come down to breakfast or order anything to be sent up, not even the continental breakfast that was included in the room rate. His colleague, Julio, said he was surprised when Felix failed to attend the first session of the conference. At the midmorning break, Julio carried a cup of coffee and a biscuit up to the room, but found the DO NOT DISTURB sign hanging on the door. He thought Felix was unwell, sleeping maybe, so he drank the coffee himself and ate the biscuit. &#x201c;We missed him at lunch,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and again in the afternoon session. By three o&#x2019;clock I was calling his phone many times, but my calls went to voice mail.&#x201d; Julio felt uneasy. It was so unlike Felix to be unreliable; so he went upstairs one more time to hammer on the door, then he summoned the hotel manager, who arrived with a key.<br><br> The two men were struck by the unnatural stillness of the room, its air of unreality; Julio said it seemed considered, or planned, like a <i>tableau vivant</i> with Felix as the centerpiece, lying on his back on the bed in a strange balletic pose, right arm cast out across the duvet, left leg bent, bathrobe open like a cape, gray eyes gazing at the ceiling. His left arm was dangling down the side of the bed, fingers suspended above the floor, and the hotel manager, who had a degree in the history of art, was reminded of the Pre- Raphaelite painting of the suicide of Thomas Chatterton. Except this didn&#x2019;t look like suicide, there were no pill bottles or razor blades or other signs.<br><br> Dr. Patel arrived, and the receptionist stood by the door while the doctor conducted her examination. Her professional opin-ion was that Felix had suffered a heart attack or had some sort of seizure after his morning run. She left, and the receptionist took photographs of Felix and of the room&#x2014;the bedside table, the pristine bathroom, the opened shower door, the view from the window and, finally, the untouched hospitality tray. &#x201c;I know that was weird,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;But it felt like the right thing to do, to make a record.&#x201d; Maybe she thought her photos might become important, that they&#x2019;d suggest that something about the scene was wrong. No one else had that sense, though. When the results of the postmortem came through, they were in agreement with Dr. Patel&#x2014;Felix&#x2019;s death was due to heart disease.<br><br> As simple as that, he had collapsed and was gone&#x2014;and for a while it seemed that he&#x2019;d simply vanished. The world had swept over him like the tide coming in.<br><br> But then the funeral happened. I trekked out of London that day to a pretty Berkshire village with a Norman church sitting amongst gravestones and windblown copper-colored leaves. When I saw it, I thought that Felix, who was born and raised in America, was having a very English final moment, though the mourners who were arriving in small solemn groups were from his international life. Solid men in sharply cut suits; flimsy, elegant women in heels. I watched them from a distance, in fact from a broken bench set against the churchyard wall, where I was trying to calm down. Eventually, I slipped into the church and stood at the back.<br><br> My sister, Tilda, was the person on show, and she walked slowly up the aisle like a melancholy bride. I tried hard, really hard, to get inside her head at that moment, and I conjured up a spectacular array of emotions&#x2014;from profound grief and loss, to exhilarating release and relief. But nothing felt right. As always, I found her confusing, and I was reduced to noticing her expensive clothes. The black silk dress, the tailored jacket, doubtless costing a thousand pounds or more. And I watched her take a place in the empty front pew. On her right, in front of the altar, was Felix&#x2019;s coffin, under a cascade of white lilies; and to her left, on a wooden stand, a giant photo of his smiling face. A few minutes later, Felix&#x2019;s mother and father slipped in beside Tilda, and then his brother, Lucas. There was the slightest of nods towards my sister, who sat perfectly still, gazing at the floor.<br><br> The first hymn was a thin rendition of &#x201c;The Lord Is My&nbsp; Shepherd&#x201d;&#x2014;but I found that I couldn&#x2019;t sing. Instead I slumped against the back wall, feeling faint and nauseous, overwhelmed by the occasion. Not that I was mourning Felix, although the sight of his hunched-up, grieving family was upsetting. It was more that I was sick with knowing too much. On the day of his death, I&#x2019;d waited for the police to turn up at my flat or at the bookshop. It was the same on the morning of the postmortem. And now, at the funeral, it seemed certain that police officers were waiting for me outside the church, stamping their feet to keep warm, sneaking an illicit cigarette, and that as soon as I stepped out of the gloom into the autumn sun I would hear my name.

Although highly informative about what it is to be part of Libya&#x2019;s tormented history, it is even more valuable as an expression of both filial and paternal love.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>London Evening Standard<br><br></i></b>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s begin with the obvious: read <i>The Return</i> before you read anything else. . . .

In this triptych of beloved country, father and the art that survives, Matar moves us with the force of his compassion, grace and fury. . . .

Bill Davis -- a Yalie and fellow adventurer who had survived the Depression running arms during the Spanish Civil War -- would become Hemingway's close friend and bullfight-traveling companion in those pivotal summer months of the author's struggle for sanity and survival.<br>"Tony Castro's&nbsp;<i>Looking for Hemingway,</i>" NPR noted in its praise of the book, "revisits the time and places that marked the great novelist's sad 'literary curtain call,' in a book filled with famous cameos and the ghost of the Davis' son, Teo, who haunts its pages."<i></i><br><i>Looking for Hemingway&nbsp;</i>explores that incredible friendship and offers a rare intimate look into the final period of the legendary writer's life, giving comprehension not only of a writer's despair but of suicide as a not unreasonable conclusion to a blasted existence.&nbsp;</p><p><b>An Interview With Tony Castro About Hemingway</b><b></b><br><b>What brought you to this subject and then what compelled you to write an entire book on it?</b><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my lifelong fascination with Ernest Hemingway had its genesis in my youth when an English teacher who had taken a special interest in my insatiable appetite for reading introduced me to&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and The Sea.</i>&nbsp;I quickly found myself devouring that book and in rapid succession every Hemingway short story and novel that I could find - and eventually earned me the reputation of having read every book in my hometown public library in Waco, Texas.<br>&nbsp;The obsession with Hemingway eventually led to an unauthorized visit to Cuba in the 1960s along with a group of Chicano movement activists and members of the Students for a Democratic Society. The revolutionary romance of Fidel Castro's Cuba had made it a popular destination for the New Left, but I was hardly the political sort. I was an undergraduate at Baylor University, a conservative Baptist college in the heart of the South's Bible Belt, and through a Latin American studies professor at the University of Texas made the connection of a lifetime. He had known Fidel Castro in Mexico in the 1950s, and he arranged for me a special tour of La Finca Vig�a, the Hemingway home in San Francisco de Paula, Cuba.<br>&nbsp;So I guess I was a romantic with a destiny of which I wasn't even aware. A few years after college, I moved into a writer friend's house in Houston, which had an unexpected connection to Hemingway. Was it simply an incredible coincidence that my friend's previous housemate had been Teo Davis, the son of the wealthy American expatriates who had hosted Hemingway in his last two visits to Spain before his suicide?<br>&nbsp;A couple of years later, while on a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard, I shared this story with the two professors with whom I was studying literature - the Mexican writer and future Nobel laureate Octavio Paz and Homeric scholar Robert Fitzgerald. Both urged me to also spend time during my fellowship studying the newly opened collection of Hemingway papers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Both Paz and Fitzgerald joined me the first time I visited the collection. Fitzgerald bailed on us afterward, but Paz and I closed down the Faculty Club at Harvard that night toasting Hemingway with shots of tequila.<br>&nbsp;Then in the 1980s, in yet one more twist of coincidence, I finally met Teo Davis in Los Angeles where we began a friendship that has spanned over three decades. It was Teo who introduced me to Mike Hamilburg, a literary agent who represented me until his illness and death. Mike tried for well over twenty years to convince Teo to write a book about his experience as a child with Hemingway when he had stayed in Spain at the Davis villa La Consula in 1959. Finally, after years of trying to coax the story out of him, I gave up, and Teo, somewhat relieved, &nbsp;said that I should write the story and that he would help as best he could. This book, though, isn't the book Mike had envisioned Teo writing. That book Teo took with him to the grave.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is this book about?</b><br>For me, there has always been in the story of Hemingway and Spain an allure so sharp and fresh that there was never any question of writing this book. There has been, from the start, the joy of rediscovering the world in which he walked and traveled, both in the 1920s and again in 1959. Here was a canvas as generous, colorful, and grand as any in Hemingway's life. As the story pushed forth, there was at every turn the excitement of history never told, of connections hidden for decades, of old mysteries answered.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The story of Hemingway the icon was well known. The story of Hemingway the man and his friendship with Bill and Anne Davis at their magnificent home had been buried. Getting that story was slow work. After a good while, I felt I had become the crypt of Hemingwayol� en La Consula. As my patient wife Renee used to say (but seldom aloud - for which I thank her) about this project, great effort went in but nothing came out until now.<br>&nbsp;For me, too, as a child of the 1950s who read&nbsp;<i>The Old Man and The Sea&nbsp;</i>thinking I was the boy Manolin, I suppose I have been looking for Hemingway all my life, and perhaps it seems fitting that I think I have found him at an age when I now see myself in the old man Santiago.&nbsp;Looking for Hemingway&nbsp;is about Hemingway at that age we all dread of being: Old, losing our train of thought, unable to do what once came so easily, too quick to show our frustration at our slowness but still holding on to the hope of one last glimmer of youth. And it is not an easy age to face, especially for publishers. More than a few just flat out said they didn't think any readers, especially Hemingway fans, wanted to read about him as an old man, pathetic at times, feeble and paranoid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a life-long Hemingway lover, I found that hard to believe, unless it's just simply old age some of us don't want to face, whether Hemingway's or our own. For those who fear this life stage, I can only say that I found it inspiring in the research to learn that Pablo Picasso in his sixties was having affairs with gorgeous youthful women more than forty years younger - young enough to be his granddaughters. A dirty old man? Maybe not so dirty if you're Picasso.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, the aging, dying Hemingway is one I have come to love and appreciate as much as the young romantic Hemingway, for in his mortality lie the same fears, regrets and self-recriminations that all of us face in our own way as we reach that stage in our lives.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;A theme in the book is the Lost Generation. Explain why.</b><br>Hemingway made famous the Lost Generation of post-World War I in Europe --&nbsp;American expatriates thought by many to have been drunkenly decadent, wildly self-indulgent, and irretrievably ruined. It was the cultural backdrop for his breakthrough novel&nbsp;<i>The Sun Also Rises,</i>&nbsp;published in 1926. And it's a theme not that dissimilar from what emerged in the months of Hemingway's 1959 visit to Spain. Ernest chased young women as unashamedly in 1959 as he had pursued the beautiful and recently divorced British socialite Lady Duff Twysden in 1925, being as insensitive to Mary as he had been his first wife Hadley back in the mid-1920s. And Hemingway in 1959 behaved almost as badly as he and his entourage did back in 1925. But there were other similarities. A writer who visited the Davis villa in Spain in 1959 said Bill and Annie Davis were "the Gerald Murphys of the fifties, transferred to the new high bohemian playground of the Gold Coast of Spain." The Gerald Murphys were a wealthy American expatriate couple known for their own lavish soirees on the French Riviera where they entertained writers and artists of The Lost Generation in the 1920s. And this was the exact kind of setting surrounding Hemingway in Spain in 1959.<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;You did a lot of research. Tell us about it.</b><br>Of course, there were countless interviews with my friend Teo Davis, son of Bill and Anne. But there was a matter also tracking down memoirs, unpublished and published, letters, journals and books, particularly some in Spain. This period of Hemingway's life was never written about in any depth by anyone but instead it was finding bits and pieces in various sources, mostly in Spain and Paris where the Davises had homes. I was also incredibly fortunate while I was a columnist at the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Herald Examiner&nbsp;</i>of being a desk mate to the late Jim Bacon, who was perhaps the most famous print journalist who ever covered Hollywood. He knew a number of people in Hollywood who had known Hemingway and the Davises, people like Lauren Bacall and Orson Welles. Even in the 1980s, as I was playing around with the idea of a book about Hemingway in Spain, Ms Bacall and Mr. Welles were gracious in providing me with their insights.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1959, the most famous literary figure of his time sets out in the twilight of his life on a quixotic quest to recapture &nbsp;his early success in the 1920s. The experience tested&nbsp;all the credos of bravery and grace under pressure he had lived by.<br>Just months before turning sixty, Ernest Hemingway headed for Spain to write an epilogue for a reissue of his bullfighting nonfiction classic <i>Death in the Afternoon,</i> as well as an article for <i>Life</i> magazine. His hosts were Bill and Anne Davis, wealthy Americans in pursuit of the avant-garde life of the 1920s post-war expatriates who lavishly entertained celebrities and the literati, from Noel Coward to Laurence Olivier, at their historic villa, La Consula. This hacienda would also become Hemingway's home during what would become the most pivotal months of the last two years of the Nobel laureate's life, and Bill Davis -- a fellow adventurer, a Yalie who survived the Depression running arms during the Spanish Civil War -- would become his close friend and bullfight traveling companion.<br>Looking for Hemingway: Spain, The Bullfights, and A Final Rite of Passage explores that incredible friendship and offers a rare intimate look into the final period of the legendary author's life, detailing not only a writer's despair but also suicide as a non unreasonable conclusion to a blasted existence.&nbsp;</p><h2>Revelation and Mystery in Ancient Judaism and Pauline Christianity</h2><p>Based on the author&#39;s thesis (Ph.

This guide tells Freud's life story and reviews his major works on dreams and sexuality. The book also takes a critical look at Freud's philosophical opponents (Jung, Wittgenstein, Adler, Eysenck, and Reich) and his modern-day heirs (Horney, Lacar, Winnicott, and Kristeva). The feminist perspective is explored in great detail, its values posing a radical challenge to the core of Freud's suppositions.<br>Whether motivated by cerebral curiosity or a simple attempt to elevate their level of cocktail chatter, Freud for Beginners aims to educate readers of every generation who are interested in the ongoing history of psychoanalysis.</p><p></p><h2>Maroo of the Winter Caves</h2><p>Maroo, a girl of the Ice Age, must take charge after her father is killed and lead the rest of the family to the tribe&#39;s winter camp.</p><p>Ann Turnbull has written nearly 30 books for children.

[and] required reading for anyone in the Anglophone world with an academic interest in Nazism. The immense value of the current, and final, volume in the series lies not so much in the continuing tradition of clearly written text and imaginatively chosen documents, though these virtues survive, as in the fact that much of the history of the home front is still relatively virgin territory. The documentary thread running through the text has to tell a story which cannot easily be discovered from any other source. ... None of the entries is superfluous; each tells a part of the wider story, which is unobtrusively woven around the documents by a deft editorial hand.

Yoon, or &#34;Shining Wisdom,&#34; decides that her name looks much happier written in Korean than in English (&#34;I did not like YOON. Lines. Circles. Each standing alone&#34;). Still, she struggles to please her parents by learning an unfamiliar language while surrounded by strangers. Although her teacher encourages her to practice writing &#34;Yoon,&#34; the child substitutes other words for her name, words that better express her inner fears and hopes. Calling herself &#34;CAT,&#34; she dreams of hiding in a corner and cuddling with her mother. As &#34;BIRD,&#34; she imagines herself flying back to Korea. Finally, she pretends she is &#34;CUPCAKE,&#34; an identity that would allow her to gain the acceptance of her classmates. In the end, she comes to accept both her English name and her new American self, recognizing that however it is written, she is still Yoon. Swiatkowska&#39;s stunningly spare, almost surrealistic paintings enhance the story&#39;s message. The minimally furnished rooms of Yoon&#39;s home are contrasted with views of richly hued landscapes seen through open windows, creating a dreamlike quality that complements the girl&#39;s playful imaginings of cats on the chalkboard, trees growing on walls, and a gleeful flying cupcake. At first glance, Yoon seems rather static, but her cherubic face reveals the range of her feelings, from sadness and confusion to playfulness, and finally pride. A powerful and inspiring picture book.</p><p></p><h2>Mood Food: Nourishing Your God-Given Emotions</h2><p>Angry. Afraid. Sad. Ashamed. For many people, the struggle with emotions is long lasting and deeply disturbing. When you feel negative emotions, how do you respond? In a culture where anxiety is an epidemic and there are myriad ways to numb our discomfort, are you often overwhelmed? Or do you simply check out? Truth is, Jesus longs to be present with us when we are in emotional distress. God never meant for his children to hide from their shame, pretend they&#39;re not angry, run away when they&#39;re scared, or anesthetize their sadness. Our emotions serve a purpose, by design! In his book, Mood Food, Dr. Melvin W. Hanna examines human emotions through a biblical lens and tells how to move on from fear to faith, sadness to comfort, shame to a new identity. &#34;My wife and I found that many people, both young and old from many cultures, struggle with fears which keep them from entering into the fullness of life or doing the will of God. Still others wrestle with anger because of the injustice of the abuse they&#39;ve suffered, or because they feel helpless to change an abusive situation. Their life experiences and emotional consequences differ, but there is a common theme. These people suffer emotional oppression, locked in an emotional prison from which they feel powerless to escape. I want to raise hope that there is a way out of this emotional prison. This way out does not involve a &#34;quick fix,&#34; but instead involves learning a new way to live. In this book I present a case that achieving an ongoing relational connection with Jesus is the first step in a journey out of emotional bondage.&#34;-Author Melvin H. Hanna By gaining an understanding of our emotional makeup through a biblical perspective in Mood Food, Dr. Hanna reveals God&#39;s original design for human emotions. He shares proven, scripture-based strategies to transform your emotional life, redirect your emotions to move you into a deeper relationship with God, and help accomplish His purposes for your life. Complete with end-of-chapter reflection exercises, Mood Food is an ideal personal or group study.</p><p>Dr. Melvin W. Hanna; BA in chemistry from UCLA; PhD in organic chemistry from University of Minnesota; resource instructor, University of the Nations (1998-Present). For the past twenty-five years, Dr. Hanna has taught students and staff of Youth With A Mission around the globe, and he also ministers to college students at University of Colorado.<em>"...many Christians are overwhelmed and find their emotions painful or confusing, either because they misunderstand their emotions, or mishandle them. When they lose control of their emotions they feel stunted and fear that God has abandoned them. This is why Melvin Hanna's book, <strong>Mood Food</strong>, is a welcome resource in a time when there is much confusion about the role emotions play in the lives of Christian believers. The main themes of the book point us back to scripture and how we can use the spiritual discipline of learning to converse with Jesus about our emotional states and transform these emotions so that they help us to discover God's purpose for them." </em><strong>-Archibald D. Hart, Ph.D., FPPR. Senior Professor of Psychology and Dean Emeritus, Graduate School of Psychology, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California.</strong><br> <br> <em>&#x201c;In an age where a person's immature emotions are often sabotaging his success and relationships this is a very welcome and much needed work. Melvin Hanna writes out of a wealth of experience teaching students at the University of the Nations in many countries of the world.&nbsp; He is greatly respected by students and his University colleagues.&nbsp; This lucid, practical and helpful approach in developing emotional maturity is both refreshing and life changing.&#x201d;</em><strong> &#x2013; Dr. Bruce Thompson, International Dean Emeritus, College of Counseling and Health Care, University of the Nations</strong><br> <br> <em>"How do we harness core emotions such as shame, fear, anger, and sadness to allow them to work for us rather than against us?&nbsp; Dr. Hanna confronts this question with the rationality one would expect of a chemistry professor, but with the insight and compassion of a follower of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; God created us with emotions for a purpose: to motivate us to glorify Him.&nbsp; The new way of living that this book proposes is the life-long habit of conversing with Jesus about the emotions we feel in given situations and listening to His reply.<br> <br> As I read this book I stopped to ponder Hanna&#x2019;s advice.&nbsp; What would my life have been like had I paused to ask God how to deal with emotional situations?&nbsp; The answer came to me before the question was formed.&nbsp; I think it will to all of Dr. Hanna&#x2019;s readers.<br> <br> I highly recommend this book as an outstanding guide to daily living."</em>&nbsp; <strong>-Keith M. McDonald&nbsp; M.D., Author of <em>A Time to Mourn , A Time to Dance, and Bristlecone Mountain</em></strong></p><h2>R is for Ricochet (Kinsey Millhone Alphabet series)</h2><p><p><i>R is for Ricochet </i>is the eighteenth in the Kinsey Millhone mystery series by Sue Grafton.</p><p>Kinsey Millhone, employed by Nord Lafferty to drive his daughter home from her incarceration at the Californian Institute for Women, marvels at the simplicity of the task. But Reba Lafferty emerges feisty and rebellious, and Kinsey is soon fighting to prevent her charge from breaking the conditions of her parole.</p><p> As she finds herself befriending the ex-gambler, ex-alcoholic and ex-con, Kinsey discovers that Reba had taken the fall for her boss, also her lover, when he conducted a highly-crafted money laundering scam. Alan Beckwith has so far escaped the clutches of the FBI. Now they believe he is laundering money for a Columbian drug cartel - they just need the proof.</p><p> When Kinsey is asked by the police to persuade Reba to unveil crucial evidence guaranteed to put Beckwith behind bars, she doesn&#x2019;t expect cooperation. But when she hears of shocking new information about her lover, Reba is suddenly all too eager to do everything she can to ruin him.</p><p> Embroiled in a cunning challenge of wits, and meanwhile bemused by her own blossoming romance, Kinsey must try to control the bitter, angry Reba as she launches her dangerous revenge . . .</p></p><p>When wealthy octogenarian Nord Lafferty hires Kinsey Millhone to help his newly paroled daughter find her way back to the straight and narrow after doing time for embezzlement, the Santa Teresa P.I. has no idea what she's getting into. Reba Lafferty's ex-boss, land developer Alan Beckwith, is the man who sent her to prison--so how come she's meeting him just hours after her release, and treating Kinsey to an X-rated reunion scene played out in his parked Mercedes? And why is he also playing sex games with Reba's formerly best friend, who still works for him? A visit from an old friend from the FBI clears up the mystery--Beckwith is suspected of running a money-laundering game, and they need Reba to make their case by rolling over on him. It&#x2019;s not until Millhone presents Reba with photographic evidence of Beckwith's two-timing that she agrees to do what the Feds want... but she'll only do it her way, which could get a lot of people killed. Grafton fleshes out this well-crafted thriller with a romantic subplot involving a romantic triangle that features Kinsey's elderly landlord Henry, his brother, and a vivacious widow who can't seem to choose between them. It doesn't add much to the plot, but the fans of this evergreen series (who must be wondering what will happen to Millhone when Grafton gets to the end of the alphabet) probably won't mind a bit. <i>--Jane Adams</i><b>New York Times</b> bestselling author Sue Grafton is published in 28 countries and 26 languages&#x2014;including Estonian, Bulgarian, and Indonesian.

Here are their stories concerning the creation of the universe, the theft of fire and daylight, the death and rebirth of salmon, and especially, the formation of such geographical features as The Dalles, the Columbia River, the Yukon River, and Mounts Shasta, Hood, Rainier, Baker, and Adams.&nbsp;Katharine Berry Judson began with native oral tradition in retelling these stories. They represent, as Jay Miller says, &#x201c;a distillation of tribal memory and a personification of environmental wisdom.&#x201d; Some legends&#x2014;&#x201c;Duration of Life,&#x201d; &#x201c;Old Grizzly and Old Antelope,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Robe of Kemush&#x201d;&#x2014;are almost literal translations, recorded by government ethnologists. Animating the beautifully wrought tales are entities like Coyote, Old Man Above, Owl and Raven and other Animal People, and Chinook Ghosts.</p><p>Katharine Berry Judson was a professor of history at the University of Washington. She compiled and edited four collections of native myths and tales, including <i>Myths and Legends of California and the Old Southwest</i>, also available as a Bison Book.&nbsp;Jay Miller, formerly assistant director and editor at the D&#x2019;Arcy McNickle Center for the History of the American Indian at the Newberry Library, is an independent scholar and writer teaching the grammar of Tsimshian in Prince Rupert, British Columbia.

Deciding the situation in England is&nbsp;too unstable, Nick's mother sends him to live with his father in Burma, hoping he will be safer living on the family's teak plantation.&nbsp;But as soon as Nick arrives, trouble erupts in this remote Burmese elephant village. Japanese soldiers invade, and Nick's father is taken prisoner. Nick is stranded on the plantation, forced to work as a servant to the new rulers. As life in the village grows more dangerous for Nick and his young friend, Mya, they plan their daring escape. Setting off on elephant back, they will risk their lives to save Nick's father and Mya's brother from a Japanese POW camp.&nbsp;In this thrilling journey through the jungles of Burma, Roland Smith explores the far-reaching effects of World War II, while introducing&nbsp;readers to the fascinating world of wild timber elephants and their mahouts.</p><p><br><b>Roland Smithis the author of<i>Zach's Lie</i>, an ALA Quick Pick for Reluctant Readers;<i>Cryptid Hunters</i>;<i>Thunder</i><i></i><i>Cave</i>;<i>Jaguar</i>;<i>The Last Lobo</i>; and<i>Sasquatch</i>. He lives outside of Portland, Oregon, with his wife Marie, who also writes children's books.</b>At the height of&nbsp;the London blitz, Nick&#x2019;s mother sends him to join his father on the family&#x2019;s remote, ancestral timber plantation in Burma. Her gambit turns out badly: The invading Japanese soon seize the plantation,&nbsp;imprisoning his father&nbsp;in a brutal POW camp, and leaving 13-year-old Nick to endure&nbsp;hardship under Japanese overseers (whose characterizations are less&nbsp;complex than those of the diverse Burmese). As readers will expect from suspense-specialist Smith, Nick faces exciting situations (including several weeks in the estate&#x2019;s secret catacombs), and&nbsp;details of Burmese politics, spirituality,&nbsp;and daily life&nbsp;weave an alluring backdrop. Some readers, however, may feel disoriented by Smith&#x2019;s fragmented storytelling style, in which momentum often seems to consolidate around one character or plot development only to move suddenly in an entirely new direction. Still, this offering&#x2019;s unusual setting deserves attention from historical fiction fans, who will appreciate the window on a rarely discussed theater of&nbsp;World War II.

She argues that the Romantics in France made the heroism of modern life their creed and "transferred their idealism to the domain of art, either as practitioners or as critics."<br><br>Here is Gros as hero and victim, Alfred de Musset as <i>enfant du siecle</i>, Delacroix as Romantic Classicist, and later in the century, Zola as an advocate of life for art's sake and Huysman's indulging in the madness of art.<br> <br>In <i>Romanticism and Its Discontents</i>, Anita Brookner takes us on a fascinating tour of these artists, poets, and critics, bringing unfamiliar works brilliantly to life and casting a new light on more recognizable ones.<br></p><p><b>Anita Brookner</b> trained as an art historian and taught at the Courtauld Institute of Art until 1988. She has written a number of books on art history, and nineteen novels, including the 1984 Booker Prize winner, <i>Hotel du Lac</i>. She lives in London.<br>Following her earlier biography of the neoclassicist painter Jacques-Louis David, acclaimed novelist and art historian Brookner (Hotel du Lac; Falling Slowly; etc.) here tackles the French Romantics. As a brief outline of the movement, this study breaks no new ground, but it is a fluent and shapely introduction that covers the major names, with chapters devoted to artists Ingres, Delacroix and Gros, writers Musset, Baudelaire, Zola and Huysmans, and the Goncourt brothers. As in the David biography, which focused on how the artist's later career was ruined by his homosexuality, and as in Brookner's novels of the rich, sensitive and depressed, the latter part of the title (a takeoff on Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents) rules the interpretations here. With artists like Baron Gros, Brookner wonderfully integrates psychobiography with social history, implying that during the Terror following the French Revolution, this artist's paranoia was sensible and lifesaving. The Goncourt brothers are lauded for their "unflinching pessimism which cannot quite conceal a sorrowing outlook." Brookner overrates Madame de Sta?l and misleadingly calls the tyrannically gifted 18th-century epistolary artist Madame du Deffand "a modest and discreet person." Despite a novelist like Zola, who personified "Romanticism as energy," the final word is given to the "constitutionally depressed" critic Sainte-Beuve. (Surprisingly, there is no bibliography or list of suggested reading.) Brookner definitely paints the Romantics with her own brushAmaking sure that no one has too good a timeAbut she communicates her highly personal view with the sureness of a professional in literary low spirits.

Kat was named the prime suspect and, on a string of circumstantial evidence, charged and tried. While the jury found her innocent, not everyone else agreed, and her only choice was to go into hiding. But she carried a dark secret with her, one that made her worry she might actually have had something to do with Sara's death . . .</p><p>Now, years later, Kat is still haunted by her sister's unsolved murder and continues to receive chilling anonymous letters, but she has tried to move on with her life. Until, on the tenth anniversary of Sara's death, she receives a letter that makes the past impossible to ignore: "What about justice for Sara?" What <i>about</i> justice for Sara? And for herself? Kat realizes that going back to Liberty, Louisiana, might be the only way to move forward and find some peace. And there's a killer out there who was never caught.</p><p>But the town she's come back to is hardly different from the one she left. The secrets and suspicions still run deep.

Simple. Ugly. A warning. <br>We know u did it <br> <i>No surprise there</i>. Kat shifted her gaze. The once sunny yellow had turned forlorn. The white trim was peeling, the gardens overgrown and overrun by weeds. She pictured it as it had been the last time she&#x2019;d seen it, ten years ago. The cute gingerbread cottage with the white picket fence, gardenias in bloom, their fragrance potent in the June sun. <br>Not her childhood home. No, that had been a grand estate on the Tchefuncte River. Plantation grand&#x2014;with white columns and a double gallery, a sweeping expanse of lawn with ancient live oaks and century-old magnolias. A swimming pool and cabana. A guesthouse and tennis courts. A home befitting the owner of McCall Oil. <br>No, this had been her sister Sara&#x2019;s cottage. Her first home, her pride and joy. <br>As it had turned out, the only home Sara would ever own. <br>Regret and grief washed over Kat, as piercing as a fresh wound. If she hadn&#x2019;t been such a selfish little shit back then, maybe Sara would be alive today. Maybe her murderer wouldn&#x2019;t have had the opportunity. <br>Kat reined in her thoughts, the regret. She couldn&#x2019;t change the past, no matter how hard she fought accepting it, no matter how far or fast she ran from it. <br>Being back in Liberty was an acknowledgment of that. <br>Kat unlatched the gate and stepped through. She&#x2019;d thought she would never return. She had promised herself she wouldn&#x2019;t. <br>Yet here she was. The scene of the crime. The place her life had come to a bloody, screeching halt. <br>She started up the walkway, heartbeat quickening. Breath coming fast and thin. Kat forced herself to keep moving, to put one foot in front of the other. She reached the porch steps. Three of them, though it could have been a hundred by the way she dreaded climbing them. <br>She did anyway. Crossed to the front door. With unsteady hands, she fit the key into the lock, turned it and stepped into the foyer. <br>Cousin Jeremy had opened the cottage and had it cleaned for her. The smell of the polish and cleaners still hung in the air. She closed the door behind her but didn&#x2019;t move. <br>Her gaze went to the spot where she&#x2019;d found Sara. In a crumpled heap, blood pooled around her in the shape of an amoeba. <br>An amoeba. Kat remembered thinking that. She had just studied the single-cell organisms in science class. <br>She stared at the floor, unable to tear her gaze away. The blood had subtly stained the honey-colored wood, creating a faint but permanent shadow. <br>Or was that her imagination? <br>The doorbell sounded. <br>Startled, she jumped, then, hand to her chest, peeked out the sidelight. A man. Dark hair. Good-looking. Holding up a badge. <br>The sight of it knocked the breath out of her. <br> <i>&#x201c;Miss Katherine, I&#x2019;m afraid you&#x2019;re going to have to come with me.&#x201d;</i> <br>&#x201c;Ms. McCall? Sergeant Luke Tanner. Liberty P.D.&#x201d; <br>Kat gazed at him, suddenly seeing the resemblance. Now, there was a name she had never wanted to hear again. <br>She nodded and opened the door. &#x201c;Hello, Sergeant. Did you say Tanner?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Any relationship to Chief Stephen Tanner?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;His son.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perfect.&#x201d; The sarcasm slipped past her lips before she could stop it. &#x201c;Sorry, your dad and I have some uncomfortable history together.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Funny, he and I do as well.&#x201d; <br>She surprised herself and smiled. &#x201c;How can I help you, Sergeant Tanner?&#x201d; <br>He motioned to the graffiti across the front of the house. &#x201c;I heard from Mrs. Bell across the street that you&#x2019;d had a little trouble already, thought I&#x2019;d stop by and check it out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Iris Bell&#x2019;s still alive? I thought she was a hundred ten years ago.&#x201d; <br>Kat could see he wanted to smile but thought better of it. His brown eyes crinkled at the corners. He cleared his throat. &#x201c;Probably just kids, but we&#x2019;ll be keeping a close eye on the house, stepping up drive-bys and the like.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I appreciate that, Sergeant Tanner. And I&#x2019;m sure Iris Bell will be stepping up her surveillance as well.&#x201d; <br>Again, he struggled not to smile. &#x201c;This is a small town, Ms. McCall, everybody knows everybody and their everything. To that end, you might as well call me Luke.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I remember you now. Local football hero. You were off to college before I got to Tammany West High.&#x201d; She cocked her head. &#x201c;You were a bit of a hell-raiser, am I right?&#x201d; <br>He laughed. &#x201c;So now you understand my comment about bad history with my dad. We all carry our pasts around on our backs.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Or written on our foreheads,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A bloodred &#x2018;M&#x2019; on mine.&#x201d; <br>He glanced toward the graffiti, expression serious. &#x201c;Yes, well, don&#x2019;t hesitate to call if something comes up.&#x201d; <br>She followed him onto the front porch. He stopped when he reached the stairs and turned back to her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you came back to Liberty, Ms. McCall, but little towns have long memories. People don&#x2019;t forget. You&#x2019;d be wise to keep that in mind.&#x201d; <br>She watched him drive off. How could she not? She had the longest memory of them all. <br>Sara McCall <br>2003 <br> <i>Four days before the murder</i> <br>Sara stood on the front porch, waiting for Kat. She glanced at her watch. Just past four thirty. Any moment, her sister would come trotting around the corner. Bubbling over about how well softball practice had gone. Playing Miss Innocent to the very hilt. <br>But she hadn&#x2019;t been to practice. Not today. Not once. Lying little sneak. <br>On cue, Kat arrived, baseball bat propped on her right shoulder. She was smiling. <br> <i>Not for long</i>. Sara struggled to control her anger. She shook with it. Deep down. All the way to her core. <br>She needed her wits about her when she confronted her sister. Kat was going to pitch a holy fit. It could get really ugly. If she let it. <br> <i>Calm, Sara. In control. You&#x2019;re the adult.</i> <br>The truth was, she didn&#x2019;t have the heart for this right now. She didn&#x2019;t have the energy. Not with everything else going on. But she didn&#x2019;t have a choice. She was Katherine&#x2019;s guardian. <br>&#x201c;Hi, Sissy,&#x201d; Kat called, jogging up the steps. <br>&#x201c;How was softball?&#x201d; <br>If Kat heard the sarcasm in her tone, she didn&#x2019;t show it. &#x201c;Great. I&#x2019;m getting really good.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Yes, you are.&#x201d; Sara held out her hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take the bat.&#x201d; <br>She looked confused but handed it over. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Jig&#x2019;s up, kiddo. You&#x2019;re grounded.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What! Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why? Let&#x2019;s try that you&#x2019;ve been lying to me. I found out everything, Kat. What you&#x2019;ve been doing and who you&#x2019;ve been doing it with.&#x201d; She paused, watching as the reality of what she was saying sank in. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s twenty years old. You&#x2019;re seventeen. No.&#x201d; <br>Kat&#x2019;s expression darkened. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t tell me what to do or who I can see.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The hell I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m your guardian and that&#x2019;s exactly what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fair!&#x201d; <br>Sara almost laughed. &#x201c;Tough. Life&#x2019;s not fair.&#x201d; And boy, did she know it. If it was, their parents wouldn&#x2019;t have died and she wouldn&#x2019;t have been saddled with raising an obnoxious teenager. <br>&#x201c;I hate you!&#x201d; Kat shouted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re ruining my life!&#x201d; <br>Sara didn&#x2019;t even flinch. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time her younger sister had shouted those words at her. She was certain it wouldn&#x2019;t be the last. &#x201c;Stop with the drama, Katherine. If anyone&#x2019;s life&#x2019;s being ruined, it&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then emancipate me.&#x201d; <br>They had been here before, as well. &#x201c;Emancipate yourself. You&#x2019;re seventeen.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then I won&#x2019;t get my money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right, little sister. So, either go without &#x2018;your&#x2019; money or live by my rules.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d died with Mom and Dad! Then I wouldn&#x2019;t have to live with <i>you</i>!&#x201d; <br>It took every scrap of Sara&#x2019;s self-control not to shout back that she wished that too. That she wanted her life back. That caring for Kat had become like a prison sentence. <br>But she didn&#x2019;t. She loved her sister&#x2014;at least the kid she used to be. In the past year, that girl had disappeared and this <i>creature</i> had taken her place. <br>&#x201c;Wow, Kat, I love the way you&#x2019;re playing the victim here. You&#x2019;re not the one who&#x2019;s been lied to for weeks. Girls&#x2019; softball? You didn&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;d find out eventually? I&#x2019;ve got to hand it to you, though, our trip to the sporting goods store to get everything you needed was pretty convincing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; <br>Sara wanted to slap the smirk off her face. &#x201c;What were you doing all those afternoons you were supposedly at practice? Were you with this Ryan boy? Or that group of kids I told you to stay away from? They&#x2019;re bad kids, Kat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know anything about them!&#x201d; <br>A breeze stirred the azalea bushes beside the porch. In full bloom, they provided a brilliant shock of color; from the magnolia blossoms on the tree to her right floated a sweet, almost lemony fragrance. <br>Sara breathed in the colors, the smell, using nature&#x2019;s beauty to calm her. She was the grown-up here, she reminded herself. Kat had been through so much. <br>&#x201c;Kit-Kat,&#x201d; she pleaded, using their mother&#x2019;s pet name for her, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried about you. The girl I know doesn&#x2019;t do things like this. Talk to me. No problem&#x2019;s too big we can&#x2019;t work it out together.&#x201d; <br>Kat&#x2019;s face softened, tears filled her eyes. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what it&#x2019;s like. All the other kids have their moms and dads. And mine&#x2014;&#x201d; She choked on the last, a tear rolling down her cheek. <br>Sara&#x2019;s heart hurt for her. She held out a hand. &#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re going through. I&#x2019;m going through it, too.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know. I was twelve when they died, you were grown up.&#x201d; <br>Just out of university, at her first teaching job. Barely on her own two feet. &#x201c;But I still needed them, too. I miss them every day.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;d they have to die?&#x201d; <br>She started to cry and Sara took her in her arms. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. And I wish I could change things, but I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry I lied to you. It&#x2019;s just that&#x2014;&#x201d; She sniffled, her face against Sara&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;The only time I&#x2019;m happy is when I&#x2019;m with my friends. They understand me. They make it&nbsp;&#x2026; stop hurting. That&#x2019;s why I lied about where I was.&#x201d; <br>Something in her sister&#x2019;s tone didn&#x2019;t ring true. A cloying quality. Sara frowned as a suspicion wormed its way into her head: <i>Was she being played?</i> <br>Kat went on. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know them the way I do. They&#x2019;re really good kids. Please don&#x2019;t take them away from me, too.&#x201d; <br>Sara&#x2019;s resolve wavered. She&#x2019;d heard things from the other teachers about the group. They had warned her to keep Kat away from them. But that was all secondhand information. There was a reason the courts didn&#x2019;t allow hearsay as testimony, right? <br>Sara glanced across the street. Old Mrs. Bell stood on her front porch. Listening to every word. Or trying to. <br>&#x201c;I tell you what, Kit-Kat, have them over here. Let me get to know them. If they&#x2019;re the kids you say they are, I&#x2019;ll feel comfortable letting you hang out with them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;I just have to know you&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the best!&#x201d; Kat hugged her. &#x201c;Can they come over tonight?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still grounded, Kat.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But you just said&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That I&#x2019;ll give your friends a chance. And I will. After you do your punishment.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Two weeks. And I&#x2019;m taking your phone, car and computer.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t do that! How am I supposed to get to school?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drive you.&#x201d; Kat looked horrified. &#x201c;And the answer&#x2019;s still no about you and this Ryan dude. He&#x2019;s too old for you.&#x201d; <br>Before her sister could squeal her protest, she dropped the final bomb. &#x201c;Cousin Jeremy suggested I start drug-testing you. And I think he&#x2019;s right.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The one word conveyed outrage and innocence. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you don&#x2019;t trust me!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are you kidding? Really?&#x201d; Sara folded her arms across her chest. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve got nothing to worry about, what&#x2019;s the problem?&#x201d; <br>Kat stared at her, her face an open book as she stuttered and searched for the right response. <br> <i>She had been playing her. Little brat.</i> <br>&#x201c;Give me your car keys.&#x201d; She held out her hand. &#x201c;Now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I lied before. I wish <i>you</i> were dead. Then I wouldn&#x2019;t have to put up with your shit!&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Want to say it a little louder? I don&#x2019;t think <i>all</i> of Liberty heard you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I wish you were dead!&#x201d; she screamed, turning toward the street. &#x201c;You hear that, everyone? I wish my stupid sister were dead!&#x201d; <br>Kat threw the car keys. Sara reacted just in time not to take them square in the face. They grazed her cheek before hitting the wall and dropping to the floor. It stung; her eyes teared up and she brought her hand to her cheek. <br>But instead of apologizing, Kat stormed past her into the house. A moment later, she heard a door slam. <br>Sara sank onto the porch step and dropped her head into her shaking hands. What was she going to do? She was frustrated. Overwhelmed and exhausted. And it wasn&#x2019;t just the situation with Kat. It seemed every part of her life had spun out of control as well, situations that made dealing with a rebellious teenager a piece of cake. <br> <i>Mom, Dad, why&#x2019;d you have to go out that night? Why&#x2019;d your path have to cross that drunk&#x2019;s?</i> <br>She couldn&#x2019;t do this alone. But who could she trust? It seemed like everyone had either turned against her or had their own agenda. If ever she could have used a miracle, it was now. <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Erica Spindler <br></p><h2>A Rose for Pinkerton</h2><p>Pinkerton&#39;s family decides he needs a friend, but is a cat named Rose really suitable?</p><p><b>Steven Kellogg</b> is a beloved author and illustrator who has published more than 100 picture books, including the classics <i>The Mysterious Tadpole, Can I Keep Him?, The Island of the Skog, </i>and<i> Is Your Mama a Llama?,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Pinkerton, Behave!,</i> which was on <i>Horn Book'</i>s and <i>Booklist&#x2019;s</i> Best of the Year lists and led to four sequels.

The waters at the ocean entrance to San Francisco Bay were too menacing; the Gate was too wide to be spanned by a suspension bridge; the costs of so ambitious a project were too high for an economy in the midst of Depression. <br><br>But impossible odds are fuel for the determination of a visionary engineer like Joseph Strauss, and danger is no more than a welcome companion to the steel-nerved bridgemen who willingly risk their lives to turn dreams such as his into reality. <br><br>In 1916, the long fight for the Golden Gate Bridge began. Twenty-one years later, in May 1937, the impossible dream was a dazzling reality. The intervening years were filled with drama, disappointment and accomplishment. The Golden Gate required the largest underwater foundation piers ever built, the tallest towers and the longest, thickest cables. What's more, the foundation had to be sunk in the violent, pounding waters of the open sea. But the first, and in many ways most difficult challenge, was convincing Bay Area counties to lend their support to a $35 million construction bond issue in an era of breadlines and rampant unemployment..an undertaking that lasted nearly four times as long as the actual construction.</p><p></p><h2>PAPA LIKE EVERYONE</h2><p>Gisella hopes her father will return to Hungary, but World War I separates them for five years</p><p></p><h2>The History of American Wars</h2><p>A vivid and incisive account analyzes the causes of each American war, the strategy employed, relations between the civilian command and the military, the technology of weapons, and the financial and economic background</p><p></p><h2>The Dove</h2><p>Katy Lynn Logan had two friends: Andy, her father's best friend through his whole life who'd been her surrogate father/uncle/mother/best friend since the day of her birth. And then there was Joshua Carter, the love of her heart and her soul mate. Or so she thought until that day when she buried her father; the same day Joshua broke her heart and tore her soul apart. Seven years later Joshua returns to find his preacher father had been right. Katy Lynn Logan&nbsp;had turned out exactly like her immoral mother and drunk father. She ran a saloon on the banks of the Red River called The Soiled Dove. He can scarcely believe the beautiful piano player is his Katy, but then, seven years changes everyone. Katy can't believe her eyes when she finds Joshua sitting on a bar stool in The Dove, but the real shock comes a few days later when she finds him preaching in her church in Spanish Fort, Texas. Joshua's attraction to Katy&nbsp;did not die when his father sent him away from Spanish Fort. Katy had not buried her attraction to Joshua when she built a saloon or buried herself in hard work. Neither of them tried to deny it, but they both determined they'd sure get over it. Or would they?</p><p>Award-winning author Carolyn Brown has written over thirty books.

Bu�uel (1900-1983) came to international attention with his first films, <i>Un Chien Andalou</i> (with Dal�, 1929) and <i>L'�ge d'Or</i> (1930): two surprisingly avant-garde productions that established his position as the undisputed master of Surrealist filmmaking. He went on to make 30 full-length features in France, the US and Mexico, and consolidated his international reputation with a Palme d'Or for <i>Viridiana </i>in 1961, and an Academy Award in 1973 for <i>The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie</i>. He corresponded with some of the most famous writers, directors, actors and artists of his generation and the list of these correspondents reads like a roll call of major twentieth-century cultural icons: Fellini, Truffaut, Vigo, Aragon, Dal�, Unik - and yet none of this material has been accessible outside specialist archives and a very small number of publications in Spanish and French.</p><p><p><b>Jo Evans </b>is Senior Lecturer in the School of European Languages, Culture and Society at University College London, UK.

Amongst much else that is as intimate as it is open, these letters communicate Bu�uel's wry, amused and bemused reflections, his memories as works-in-progress, and his frequent efforts to set straight twisted records.

More than four decades on, Fanon&#x2019;s work still inspires liberation movements today. Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves &#x2013; and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives &#x2013; and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are.</p><p>Frantz Fanon (1925 &#x2013; 1961) was an author from Martinique, essayist, psychoanalyst, and revolutionary. He was perhaps the preeminent thinker of the 20th century on the issue of decolonization and the psychopathology of colonization.

An irony is that South Carolina&#x2019;s government officials made the shag and beach music the official dance and music of the state without even understanding or noting it&#x2019;s remarkable historical significance. <p>Over the years, the state&#x2019;s music and dance has almost completely been co-opted by Southern whites, leaving a new generation of blacks unaware of the cultural phenomenon they helped create. It is sad that many young blacks in South Carolina have rejected beach music and the shag because they think the music has white-only roots. Years of racism and a lack of education have helped erase one of South Carolina&#x2019;s most notable creative accomplishments. </p><p>I chose the title &#x2018;Whitewash&#x2019; for this book because only after researching these stories did I learn that each continues to live and remain fiercely unresolved for a reason. Elaborate efforts have been made to distort and misrepresent each story and to omit it from the state&#x2019;s official history. Perhaps the reason for this, I found, is because these stories share cultural attributes that go back to the antebellum South: stubbornness, pride, honor, and denial.

He lives in EnglandSet in December 1303, Doherty's intricate 15th Hugh Corbett mystery (after 2009's The Magician's Death) opens after a prologue with Hugh, keeper of the secret seal of Edward I, riding into the snowbound cathedral city of Canterbury, where Sir Rauf Decontet has been murdered, perhaps by his adulterous wife. More killings follow that appear to originate in the slaying three years earlier of a pirate, Adam Blackstock, on his vessel The Waxman. A missing treasure map adds to the intrigue. An entire family is found hanged while their bodyguard has disappeared, and a spy who disguises himself as a leper also turns up dead. In addition to a richly detailed medieval courtroom scene, the prolific Doherty provides, as usual, a tantalizing locked-room puzzle. Historical mystery fans will cheer as Corbett sifts through a "farrago of half-truths" and sees to the rout of the "criminals, wolfsheads and outlaws he pursued on behalf of the Crown." (Dec.)

Between 1944 and 1955 MI6 thought it had established a major spy network inside the Soviet Union, but the book offers evidence of how the KGB had in fact organized a massive sting operation; of how, for more than a decade, British agents were dropped by boat on the Soviet coast, and many of them lost their lives; and of how, once the betrayal was revealed, MI6 officers abandoned their agents in Russia, hoping that the bungle could be explained away by Kim Philby&#39;s treachery. The book&#39;s evidence is based on newly-declassified information from Washington, Bonn and Stockholm, access to KGB files and officers, and more than 200 interviews.

The New York Central. The Canadian Northern. The Union Pacific. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe. The names of the great North American railroads are part of a remarkable story of technological achievement and economic progress. They evoke the romance and optimism of decades of westward expansion--and they recall the railroad's inescapable ties to the continent's geography.</p><p>A uniquely North American rail technology In The North American Railroad, James Vance offers a sweeping account of how the railways transformed the continent. He challenges the commonly held belief that a single rail technology spread from Britain to the rest of the world. Instead, he argues, two distinct traditions of railroad building and utilization developed simultaneously--beginning in Britain around 1825 and in the United States around 1830.</p><p>The world's greatest system of railroads </p><p>By 1917 the North American railnet had transformed the continent and become the most comprehensive in the world with a quarter of the world's trackage built in the United States alone, and a third in the U.S. and Canada combined. Illustrated with more than one hundred maps, diagrams, and historical photographs, The North American Railroad is the definitive account of that extraordinary achievement--and what it meant for the people and landscape of the continent.</p><p>"In this original and authoritative work, Vance argues that the railroad in North America is a distinct indigenous creation and not an importation from Britain and Europe. His combined familiarity with railroading, routes and cities, facilities, and North American geography is unsurpassed and the result is quite unlike anything in the historical or specialist literature."--Donald Meinig, Syracuse University</p><p>"No previous book has presented the over-all picture of the development of the North American railroad network with Vance's emphasis on the reciprocal relationships among the economic and technological conditions on the one hand and the geographic aspects of development on the other.

One of the rare books of theology one can unreservedly recommend with full sincerity.' What The Tablet said about Waterbuffalo Theology is even more true of Three Mile an Hour God - which is perhaps a still better book. Its setting is the world of South-East Asia - and beyond. Its content reflects the wide experience of the author, who must be one of the most-travelled of all modern theologians. But what gives the book its special, compelling quality is the stillness, depth and humanity which can be found on even the most crowded page.<br>'Love has its speed. It is a spiritual speed. It is a different kind of speed from the technological speed to which we are accustomed. It goes on in the depth of our life, whether we notice or not, at three miles an hour. It is the speed we walk and therefore the speed the love of God walks.'</p><p></p><h2>Tempted by a Warrior</h2><p>Lady Fiona, wed in haste, has never known marital peace.

So she sat on the beach, a gold-embroidered shawl around her slender shoulders, and glanced at the sky from time to time, watching for passing birds and hop- ing for a better omen. Five swallows would predict a safe journey for Odysseus, two swans good fortune; an eagle would indicate a victory&#x2014;or, for Odysseus, a trading success. But the skies were clear. A light wind sprang from the north. The weather was perfect for sailing.<br><br>The old galley had been repaired, debarnacled, and recalked ready for spring, but new timbers and a coat of fresh paint could not conceal her age, which showed in every line as she lay half in and half out of the shallow water.<br><br>&#x201c;Build a new ship, Ugly One,&#x201d; she had told her husband countless times. &#x201c;This one is old and tired and will be your downfall.&#x201d; They had argued about it for years. But in this she had no power to sway him. He was not by nature a sentimental man; his affable demeanor hid a core of bronze and horn, yet she knew he would never replace the old ship he had named after her.<br><br>Penelope sighed, a gentle sadness settling over her. I am that ship, she realized. I am getting old. There is gray in my hair, and the time is swiftly passing. But more significant than the fading of her chestnut hair or the increasing lines upon her face, the monthly flows of blood that indicated youth and fecundity were becoming less frequent. Soon she would be past childbearing age, and there would be no new sons for Odysseus. The sadness deepened into sorrow as she remembered pale Laertes and the fever that had melted away his flesh.<br><br>On the beach Odysseus was striding angrily around the galley, his face red, arms gesturing, bellowing at his crewmen, who hurried to load the cargo. There was a sorrow among the men, too; she could feel it as she watched them. A few days previously their comrade Portheos, whom they called Portheos the Pig, a fat, jovial, and popular young man who had sailed with the Penelope for many summers, had died. His young wife, pregnant with their fourth child, had awoken at dawn to find Portheos dead on their pallet bed beside her.<br><br>On the Penelope two crewmen were hauling on a heavy bale of the brushwood used for packing cargo in the hold. Suddenly one lost his grip and stumbled, and the other was catapulted into the sea after the stack of wood. Odysseus swore colorfully and turned to his wife, raising his arms in a gesture of despair.<br><br>Penelope smiled, her spirits lifting as she watched him. He was always happiest when about to leave for foreign shores. Throughout the spring and summer he would roam the Great Green, buying and selling, telling his stories, meeting kings and pirates and beggars.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you, lady,&#x201d; he had told her the previous night as she lay in his arms, her fingers gently curling into the red-gray hair of his chest. She had made no reply. She knew when he would remember her&#x2014;at each night&#x2019;s fall, when the dangers of the day had passed, he would think of her and miss her a little.<br><br>&#x201c;I will think of you every day,&#x201d; he added. Still she said nothing. &#x201c;The pain of your absence will be a constant dagger wound in my heart.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled against his chest and knew he felt the smile.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t mock me, woman,&#x201d; he said fondly. &#x201c;You know me too well.&#x201d;<br><br>On the beach in the dawn light she watched him as he stomped across the sand to speak to Nestor, king of Pylos and her kins- man. The contrast between the two men was remarkable. Odysseus, barrel-chested, loud, and angry, attacked each day as if it were a mortal enemy. Nestor, slim, gray, and stooped, was a small point of calm in the storm of activity on the beach. Although Nestor was only ten years older than her husband, he had the demeanor of an ancient; Odysseus was like an excited child. She loved him, and her eyes pricked with unaccustomed tears for the journeys and perils he faced.<br><br>He had returned to her only a few days before, accompanied by Nestor, after a reluctant voyage to Sparta at the request of Agamemnon, king of Mykene.<br><br>&#x201c;Agamemnon is intent on revenge,&#x201d; old Nestor had said, sitting in the megaron late in the evening, a cup of wine comfortably full in his grip, one of his hounds at his feet. &#x201c;The meeting at Sparta was a failure for him, yet he will not be diverted from his path.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The man is obsessed,&#x201d; Odysseus said. &#x201c;He summoned the kings of the west and talked of alliance and peace. Yet all the while he dreams of a war with Troy&#x2014;a war he can only fight if we all join with him.&#x201d;<br><br>Penelope heard the anger in his voice. &#x201c;Why would any join him?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;His hatred for Troy is a private matter.&#x201d;<br><br>Nestor shook his head. &#x201c;There are no private matters for the Mykene king. His ego is colossal. What touches Agamemnon touches the world.&#x201d; He leaned forward. &#x201c;Everyone knows he is angry at being thwarted by Helikaon and the traitor Argurios.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The traitor Argurios, is it?&#x201d; Odysseus snapped. &#x201c;Interesting what makes a man a traitor, is it not? A fine warrior, a man who had faithfully served Mykene all his life, was declared outlaw and stripped of his land, possessions, and good name. Then his king tried to have him killed. Treacherously, he fought for his life and that of the woman he loved.&#x201d;<br><br>Nestor nodded. &#x201c;Yes, yes, kinsman. He was a fine warrior. Did you ever meet him?&#x201d;<br><br>Penelope knew he was seeking to defuse Odysseus&#x2019; anger. She masked a smile. No one with any sense wanted to see Odysseus in a fury.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye, he sailed with me to Troy,&#x201d; Odysseus replied. &#x201c;An unpleasant man. But every one of those Mykene would have been slaughtered at Priam&#x2019;s palace had it not been for Argurios.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As it was, they were slaughtered when they returned home,&#x201d; Penelope added quietly.<br><br>&#x201c;It was called the Night of the Lion&#x2019;s Justice,&#x201d; Nestor said. &#x201c;Just two escaped, and they were declared outlaw.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And this is the king you wish to support in a war?&#x201d; asked Odysseus, swigging mightily from his wine cup. &#x201c;A man who sends valiant warriors to fight his battles and then murders them when they fail?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have not yet offered ships or men to Agamemnon.&#x201d; The old man stared into his wine cup. Penelope knew that Nestor had not argued against a war but had kept his own counsel among the kings gathered at Sparta. &#x201c;However, Agamemnon&#x2019;s ambitions affect everyone,&#x201d; he said at last. &#x201c;With him you are either friend or foe. Which are you, Odysseus?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Neither. All men know I am neutral.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Easy to be neutral when you have secret supplies of wealth,&#x201d; said Nestor. &#x201c;But Pylos depends on trading its flax up into Argos and the north. Agamemnon controls the trade routes. To go against him would be ruinous.&#x201d; He glanced at Odysseus, and his eyes narrowed. &#x201c;So tell me, Odysseus, where are these Seven Hills that are making you rich?&#x201d;<br><br>Penelope felt the tension in the room rise, and she glanced at Odysseus.<br><br>&#x201c;On the edge of the world,&#x201d; Odysseus replied, &#x201c;and guarded by one-eyed giants.&#x201d;<br><br>Had Nestor not been drinking heavily, he would have noticed the harsh edge in Odysseus&#x2019; reply. Penelope took a deep breath, preparing herself to intervene.<br><br>&#x201c;I would have thought, kinsman, that you might have shared your good fortune with others of your blood rather than a foreigner,&#x201d; Nestor said.<br><br>&#x201c;And I would have,&#x201d; Odysseus said, &#x201c;save that the foreigner you speak of discovered the Seven Hills and opened up the trade route. It is not for me to share his secrets.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Only his gold,&#x201d; Nestor snapped.<br><br>Odysseus hurled his wine cup across the room. &#x201c;You insult me in my own palace?&#x201d; he roared. &#x201c;We had to fight for the Seven Hills against brigands and pirates and painted tribesmen. That gold was hard-won.&#x201d;<br><br>The angry atmosphere lay thick in the megaron, and Penelope forced a smile. &#x201c;Come, kinsmen. You sail for Troy tomorrow for the wedding feast and games. Do not let this night end with harsh words.&#x201d;<br><br>The two men looked at each other. Then Nestor sighed. &#x201c;Forgive me, old friend. My words were ill advised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is forgotten,&#x201d; Odysseus said, gesturing at a servant to bring him another cup of wine.<br><br>Penelope heard the lie in the words and knew that Odysseus was still angry. &#x201c;At least in Troy you will be able to forget Agamemnon for a while,&#x201d; she said, seeking to change the subject.<br><br>&#x201c;The western kings are all invited to see Hektor wed to Andromache,&#x201d; Odysseus said glumly.<br><br>&#x201c;But Agamemnon will not be there, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I think he will, my love. Sly Priam will use the opportunity to bend some of the kings to his will. He will offer them gold and friendship. Agamemnon cannot afford not to go. He will be there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is he invited? After the Mykene attack on Troy?&#x201d;<br><br>Odysseus grinned and imitated the pompous tones of the Mykene king. &#x201c;I am saddened&#x201d;&#x2014;he spread his hands regretfully&#x2014;&#x201c;by the treacherous attack by rogue elements of the Mykene forces on our brother King Priam. The king&#x2019;s justice has been meted out to the outlaws.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The man is a serpent,&#x201d; Nestor admitted.<br><br>&#x201c;Will your sons compete in the games?&#x201d; Penelope asked him.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, they are both fine athletes. Antilochos will do well in the javelin, and Thrasymedes will beat any man in the archery tourney,&#x201d; he added with a wink.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be a green moon in the sky that day,&#x201d; muttered Odysseus. &#x201c;On my worst day I could spit an arrow farther than he could shoot one.&#x201d;<br><br>Nestor laughed. &#x201c;How coy you are with your wife in the room. The last time I heard you brag about your skills, you said you could fart an arrow farther.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That, too,&#x201d; Odysseus said, reddening. Penelope was relieved to see good humor restored.<br><br>On the beach the Penelope was finally fully loaded, and the crew members were straining on ropes in the effort to get the old ship refloated. The two sons of Nestor were there, both waist-deep, their backs against the timbers of the hull, pushing her out into deeper water.<br><br>The queen of Ithaka stood and brushed pebbles from her dress of yellow linen and advanced down the beach to say farewell to her king. He stood with his first mate, Bias the Black, dark-skinned and grizzled, the son of a Nubian mother and an Ithakan sire. Beside him was a massively muscled blond sailor named Leukon, who was becoming a fistfighter of some renown. Leukon and Bias bowed as she approached, then moved off.<br><br>Penelope sighed. &#x201c;And here we are again, my love, as always,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;making our farewells.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We are like the seasons,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;Ever constant in our actions.&#x201d;<br><br>Reaching out, she took his hand. &#x201c;And yet this time is different, my king. You know it, too. I fear you will have hard choices to make. Do not make bullheaded decisions you will regret afterward and cannot change. Do not take these men into a war, Odysseus.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I have no wish for war, my love.&#x201d; He smiled, and she knew he meant it, but her heart was heavy with foreboding. For all his strength, his courage, and his wisdom, the man she loved had one great weakness. He was like an old warhorse, canny and cautious, but at the touch of the whip he would ride into fire. For Odysseus that whip was pride.<br><br>He kissed both of her hands then turned and stomped down the beach and into the sea. The water was chest-high before he grabbed a rope and hauled himself up on board. Instantly the rowers took up a beat, and the old ship started to glide away. She saw him wave his arm, silhouetted against the rising sun.<br><br>She had not told him of the gulls. He would only scoff. Seagulls were stupid birds, he would say. They have no place in prophecy.<br><br>But she had dreamed of a colossal flock of gulls that blotted out the sun like a black wind rising, turning the midday sky to night.<br><br>And that wind brought death and the end of worlds.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>Knitting Counterpanes (Dover Knitting, Crochet, Tatting, Lace)</h2><p>Mary Walker Phillips nearly single-handedly brought 19th-century American counterpanes &#x2015; bed coverings &#x2015; to the attention of modern knitters.

In this provocative book, Jim Bissett chronicles the rise and fall of the Socialist Party of Oklahoma during the first two decades of the twentieth century, when socialism in the United States enjoyed its golden age.</p><p>To explain socialism&#x2019;s popularity in Oklahoma, Bissett looks back to the state&#x2019;s strong tradition of agrarian reform. Drawing most of its support from working farmers, the Socialist Party of Oklahoma was rooted in such well-established organizations as the Farmers Alliance and the Indiahoma Farmers&#x2019; Union. And to broaden its appeal, the Party borrowed from the ideology both of the American Revolution and of Christianity. By making Marxism speak in American terms, the author argues, Party activists counteracted the prevailing notion that socialism was illegitimate or un-American.</p><p></p></p><p><b>Jim Bissett</b> is Associate Professor of History at Elon College, North Carolina.

The mirror who reflects us all. Vernon Subutex was once the proprietor of Revolver, an infamous music shop in Bastille. His legend spread throughout Paris. But by the 2000s his shop is struggling. With his savings gone, his unemployment benefit cut, and the friend who had been covering his rent suddenly dead, Vernon Subutex finds himself down and out on the Paris streets. He has one final card up his sleeve. Even as he holds out his hand to beg for the first time, a throwaway comment he once made on Facebook is taking the internet by storm.

In an era of education budget cuts, wealthy donors intervening in university decisions, and right-wing groups threatening dissenters, scholars cannot expect that those in power will value their work. Can academic freedom survive in this environment&#x2015;and must we rearticulate what academic freedom is in order to defend it?<br><br>This book presents a series of essays by the renowned historian Joan Wallach Scott that explore the history and theory of free inquiry and its value today. Scott considers the contradictions in the concept of academic freedom. She examines the relationship between state power and higher education; the differences between the First Amendment right of free speech and the guarantee of academic freedom; and, in response to recent campus controversies, the politics of civility. The book concludes with an interview conducted by Bill Moyers in which Scott discusses the personal experiences that have informed her views. Academic freedom is an aspiration, Scott holds: its implementation always falls short of its promise, but it is essential as an ideal of ethical practice. <i>Knowledge, Power, and Academic Freedom</i> is both a nuanced reflection on the tensions within a cherished concept and a strong defense of the importance of critical scholarship to safeguard democracy against the anti-intellectualism of figures from Joseph McCarthy to Donald Trump.</p><p>Joan Wallach Scott is professor emerita in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Her books include <i>Sex and Secularism</i> (2017) and <i>Gender and the Politics of History</i> (Columbia, thirtieth anniversary edition, 2018). She is a long-standing member of the American Association of University Professors Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure.<i>Knowledge, </i><i>Power, </i><i>and Academic Freedom</i> is brilliant and written with admirable clarity and style. This book could not be more timely or important. (Michael B�rub�, author of author of <i>What&#x2019;s Liberal About the Liberal Arts?: Classroom Politics and &#x201c;Bias&#x201d; in Higher Education</i>)<br><br>For decades, Joan Scott has been a passionate and thoughtful advocate for academic freedom. In these penetrating essays, she explores the often subtle tensions between free inquiry and disciplinary authority, critique and orthodoxy, disruption and civility, as well as the distinctions and interplay between academic freedom and freedom of speech, which underpin academic freedom as an ethical practice essential to the academy's future. (Hank Reichman, chair of the American Association of University Professors Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure)<br><br>Joan Scott&#x2019;s incisive account of the numerous assaults on academic freedom is a timely intervention in the so-called free speech debates. Scott reminds us that the search for truth requires freedom on the part of experts to challenge prior knowledge and established theories. The forces arrayed against academic freedom, she reminds us, would love to do away with public education altogether,which in any functioning democracy is simply unacceptable. (Carolyn M. Rouse, coauthor of <i>Televised Redemption: Black Religious Media and Racial Empowerment</i>)<br><br>For anyone who cares about the survival of academic freedom in the twenty-first century, this is required reading. Scott deftly outlines the tensions, ambiguities, and paradoxes of academic freedom and proves that it is the oxygen of any healthy democracy. Readers will come away convinced that the crises of our own historical moment call for its reinvention and revitalization.

It is a time when mortal men and women are becoming gods and goddesses as news of their extraordinary adventures sweeps across the land. In this world, Epona, a woman whose life is celebrated in legend, meets Kazhak, a Scythian warrior and prince. Their stormy love affair sends them sweeping across eighth-century Europe, pursued from the Alps to the Ukraine by Kernunnos--a mysterious Druid priest known as the "Shapechanger."<br><br></p><p><br>Since 1980 Morgan Llywelyn has created an entire body of work chronicling the Celts and Ireland, from the earliest times to the present day. her critically acclaimed novels, both of history and of mythology, have been translated into many languages. She is an Irish citizen and lives in Dublin.<br><br>Chapter 1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>It was night, and the spirits walked.<br>In the lodge of the lord of the tribe, Toutorix, the Invincible Boar, Epona waited for the representatives of the spirits to come for her. Since sunrise she had carried a knot in her belly, but she refused to give in to it. She had gone through the day as if it were any other day, pretending not to notice the jealous teasing of the other girls and the suddenly speculative glances of the boys. She had eaten her meals without tasting them and had licked her fingers afterward as if she had found the food delicious. It was important to avoid offending the spirits of the animals and plants that had been sacrificed for her nourishment.<br>As the sun moved across the sky the knot in her belly became a stone. The older women began preparing her for the night's ritual, and she submitted in silence as they bathed her body in three changes of cold water, and oiled her skin with perfumed oil from a silver Hellene ewer. Rigantona watched closely to be certain no drop was wasted. It was her oil and her ewer.<br>Epona's masses of tangled, tawny hair were pulled smooth with a bronze comb and plaited into three braids, with a copper ball knotted into the end of each to signify her status as the daughter of Rigantona, the chief's wife. Rosy-cheeked Brydda batted at the balls to make them swing, and laughed like a child, but for once her infectious gaiety did not strike an answering note in Epona.<br>After sundown she could no longer wear the short tunic appropriate for children, but she was not yet a woman, so her mother wrapped her in a blanket woven of soft baby-goats' hair and pinned it securely with one of her own bronze brooches. "Be certain you return that brooch to me afterward," Rigantona said sharply. "Don't you dare lose it!"<br>Afterward. It was hard to believe there might be an Afterward, when you were going into the unknown to face the spirits. Epona looked into her mother's face and thought of all the questions she wished she could ask, but she said nothing aloud. What lay ahead was mystery. To be worthy of her blood she must face it bravely, just as any warrior went to certain death, knowing that life continued beyond. Afterward.<br>At night the spirits walked.<br>When the long purple shadows swallowed the lake the women would come for her. Epona's younger brothers and sisters sat big-eyed on their sleeping benches, waiting. The chief and his wife stood on either side of her, proud and tall, prepared for the arrival of the <i>gutuiters</i>. They heard the foot steps on the path outside. They heard the knock: three heavy blows on the wooden door.<br>Epona's heart was pounding, but she tossed her head back and stood very straight as the door was thrust open. Nematona, Daughter of the Trees and senior <i>gutuiter</i>, a wornaft as lean and vigorous, as a mountain pine in spite of her many winters, strode into the room. "We have come for the girl child," she announced with the authority of her office. Two other women entered behind her, bringing with them a scent of sweet smoke and bitter herbs.<br>"She is not ready," Rigantona protested according to custom but without sincerity. She had waited a long time for this night, to see the child leave. She held Epona by one shoulder and Toutorix took hold of the other, ready to propel the girl forward if she should threaten to humiliate them by balking. Children did sometimes struggle at this final moment, and even those who knew her best could not always predict what Epona might do.<br>"Come," Nematona commanded, holding out her hand.<br><i>I do this willingly</i>, Epona said in her mind, to her mother. <i>If I did not, you could not force me; you could not</i>! She had had many similar conversations with her mother over the sear sons, not all of them silent.<br>She clasped Nematona's hand firmly, realizing by the warmth of the <i>gutuiter</i>'s fingers how cold her own were. It would have been clever to warm her hands by the fire before the women came for her, but of course no one had suggested it and now it was too late. What was done now must be of her own doing.<br>Nematona led her from the chief's house, the other two women walking beside them, holding torches aloft. Epona ached to steal one look backward, to see if her parents were watching her straight back and squared shoulders; but she heard the door pulled shut behind her, its hinges creaking. Only the lord of the tribe had the new iron hinges Goibban had recently designed. Epona heard the thud of the bolt, signifying that the child was now barred from the lodge of the mother; she might enter again only after she had passed into her nextlife.<br>The lodge of Toutorix occupied a central position in the village, a community of dwellings and workplaces built of timber and clinging to the western shore of a narrow, winding alpine lake. Grouped around the chief's house woe the lodges of his nearest kinsmen, the nobles of the tribe, and beyond these clustered the smaller lodges of miners and craftsmen and stockmen. Arranged for convenience around the village perimeter were the workshops and carpenters' pavilion, the dome-shaped bakehouse and smokehouses, the storage pits and holding pens for the livestock. In a place of honor, slightly set apart and surrounded by precious space, stood the forge of Goibban the smith.<br>The mountains rose abruptly, crowding in on the village as if to shove it from its precariously narrow perch into the cold lake. Clinging to the forested slopes above were the lodges of more miners, for many men now worked the great Salt Mountain. In the folds of the hills, above deep wooded valleys, were the old smelters and mine shafts that had supplied the tribe with copper for bronze-making for many generations. Nearby were the huts of the charcoal burners, the strange men who held themselves apart from most aspects of village life yet faithfully cut wood and tended the smoldering charcoal mounds upon which the forge and smelters depended.<br>A timbered palisade shielded the village from view of the stony path leading up over the hills to the mountain passes. Four nights to the west, along that trail, lay the famed Amber Road leading far north to the "sea gold" of the Baltik, and south to sunny Etruria, where it was partially paved with stone and causeways had been 1milt over the frequent marshes.<br>Along this road were shipped copper ingots and bronze ornaments, furs and hides and cattle, casks of honey and resins, bales of wool beeswax and tools and countless wagon-, loads of salt, the outpouring produce of the Blue Mountains.<br>Following the same road up from the south came gold and silver, wine and olive oil, faience glass beads and topaz jewelry and ivory bangles, perfumes and dyes, and tanned strangers from lands warmed by the seas of endless summer.<br>Aside from the trail through the mountains, which villagers called the trade road, the only other access to the community was by water, across the lake. This proved a convenient route for floating out timber and bulk shipments of salt to be moved into the descending waterways and the network of rivers to the north.<br>Up the steep valley at the head of the lake was the great Salt Mountain itself, dominating the thoughts of all those within its sphere of influence, providing a wealth for the tribe of the Kelti that they could neither measure nor exhaust.<br>For most of each day, the village lay in the shadow of the towering mountains. What little level terrain existed was long since crowded with buildings, except for the tribe's common-ground, near the lodge of Toutorix. Epona and the three <i>gutuiters</i> must cross this open space on their way to the sacred grove and the house of Kemunnps, Priest of the Stag, chief priest of the Kelti.<br>Shapechanger.<br>No! Epona would not let herself think about the shape-changer. Her loathing for the man might weaken her, and she must not allow that to happen. <i>I will do this my way</i>, she said to herself. <i>My way</i>. She matched her pace to the processional stride of the <i>gutuiters</i> and pressed her lips together to keep them from quivering.<br>Sometime during the long day one of the women attending. her, Suleva, She Who Bears Only Daughters, had broken the prohibitions to whisper a fragmented warning: "You must not show fear. An awful thing will happen if..." Then the woman shrank into herself and said nothing more.<br>The <i>gutuiters</i> began the ancient chant:<br>&nbsp;<br>"<i>Maiden to sacrifice</i>,<br><i>maiden to sacrifice</i>.<br><i>See her go</i>.<br><i>See her go</i>.<br><i>Dark is the night</i>,<br><i>cold is the wind</i>.<br><i>See her go</i>.<br><i>See her go</i>.<br><i>Follow the fire</i>,<br><i>follow the-fire</i>.<br><i>See her go</i>!<br><i>See her go</i>!"<br>&nbsp;<br>They moved their upper bodies in time to the chant, bending from side to side so the torches they carried made swirling patterns of light. The swaying movements and light dizzied Epona, and it was an effort to keep her steps regular, one foot set neatly in a direct line in front of the other as was proper<br>for mountain dwellers.<br>Spectators, crowding into the doorways of their lodges, took up the chant: "Maiden to sacrifice. See her go!" Their voices rang in the night air, calling the attention of the spirits to Epona.<br>As she came abreast of each lodge, those who watched were careful to look down, for it was considered dangerous to meet eyes with a person passing between worlds.<br>An evening breeze sprang up, bringing the smoke from. Kernunnos' lodge to meet the little procession, and as they passed the house of the dead, the voice of the chief priest could be beard, joining in the chant with secret words from the language of the spirits. That harsh voice carried a long way.<br>The valley seemed to grow darker, as if the residual twilight were being sucked out of it by the smoke and the chanting. The breeze became a cold wind from mountain passes still blocked by snow, and the ice crystals it carried froze out the softer scent of the pines at the edge of the sacred grove.<br>Epona did not look at the trees, but she heard Nematona call to them with love, and heard the soughing of their branches in answer. There was a spirit of exceptional power in the sacred grove. To walk close to the gnarled trees was to feel its presence, like a multitude of eyes looking at you, like the humming of a vast hive of bees, like the breathing of great animals, crouched and waiting, thinking unimaginable thoughts.<br>The people of the village gave up the chant and went back into their sturdy safe lodges, to their bright warm fires. Only Epona and the <i>gutuiters</i> remained under the open sky, where the awakening stars could see them.<br>The path became narrow and broken, and sharp stones pressed into Epona's bare feet. Beyond the trees stood the magic house of Kernunnos, which she had never seen, for children were forbidden to go near it. It was built of oak, like the house of the dead, instead of birch, as other lodges were. The wood of the sacred tree was used for these special buildings because having once been sanctified they must stand forever, they could not foe remade.<br>There was another structural difference between the house of Kernunnos and those of other people. All other lodges of the living were rectangular; that of Kernunnos was built to conform to the sacred circle. Trees crowded close behind the priest's lodge, and Epona knew from whispered stories that the ravens of Kernunnos sat hunched like black spirits of doom in those trees, surely aware of her approach.<br>The smoke issuing from the magic house was acrid and made her cough.<br>The <i>gutuiters</i> stripped her of her blanket before shoving her inside the lodge. At first she could see nothing, could be aware of nothing but the smoke stinging her eyes and nostrils and the sound of the chanting reverberating through her being, making her part of itself. A beating like a drum. There was a drum; she could make out its voice, the booming of the priest drum, and it came closer. Something was coming closer. Something terrible and irresistible.<br>There was a shrill cry directly in front of her, and a face materialized from the smoke, a sharp-featured face like that of a fox, with yellow eyes that burned into hers. The power of those eyes made everything else fade away and she saw. only the feral gaze of Kernunnos the priest.<br><i>Shapechanger</i>!<br>Epona was nauseated by the visceral revulsion she always suffered when she was near the chief priest, but she struggled to fight it off. It must not interfere with the ritual.<br>Kernunnos was dressed in a cloak of animal skins, with dangling paws that swung limply as he circled the girl. She smelled his body; rank, musky, a wild animal's smell. His eyes stared and glittered. On his head towered the branching antler headdress that marked him as a shapechanger, the rarest of the <i>druii</i>, the most awesome member of that priesthood whose talents were passed on through the blood or, occasion ally, bestowed as a sign of exceptional favor from the spirits themselves.<br>In one hand Kernunnos grasped a piece of horn, a prong taken from the antlers of a mighty stag sacrificed generations before. The bone had been polished and sharpened to a fine point. At its tip it bore a permanent stain, hike ocher.<br>Kernunnos lifted the prong to the level of Epona's eyes and shook it at her. "Your time has come," he chanted in a singsong voice. "One life is over. One life begins. It is always so. Make ready for the spirit of the strong and the powerful, Epona, the strong and the powerful. Make ready for the sacrifice of the blood, for the blood is the life. Make ready for life, Epona."<br>"E-po-na, E-po-na," thee women chanted. They began t move, dancing, bending, forming a circle around the pair in the center, holding them within its magic ring. Circling, circling.<br>"Epona!" they cried. "Mother to daughter to mother to daughter, open the way. Open the way!" The <i>gutuiters</i> danced faster and Kernunnos began to dance too, turning with them, always holding the sharpened prong before Epona's eyes as if he were using it to lead her, She followed him because there seemed nothing else to do. Her feet had no will of their Own, moving in an ancient pattern her flesh and blood knew but her mind did not. Kernunnos Understood. His hot eyes smiled at her across the antler; through the smoke. He lowered his hand and the prong touched her breast, just pressing (he skin at first and then digging in hard, drawing blood. Kernunnos danced and turned and darted at her again and again, seeking out the tender parts of her body, watching with his feral eyes to see how she reacted.<br>He could kill her easily. He could tear open her unprotected body with that horn and kill her, and there was nothing she could do about it. Who could question a sacred ritual? Who knew what the spirits plight direct him to do? Epona had walked into mystery; no one who returned from the lodge of Kernunnos ever spoke of the ceremonies performed there. It was forbidden.<br>With balled fists held tight to her sides, she faced the priest and waited with all the dwindling courage she possessed, aware of her bravado draining out of her like urine trickling down her legs. Never before in her life had she, eldest daughter in the lodge of the chief, been hurt; only, skinned knees and stone-bruised h...</p><h2>Mobile Suit Gundam Ecole Du Ciel 6 (Gundam (Tokyopop) (Graphic Novels))</h2><p>Asuna is a below-average student at �Ecole du Ciel where teachers and students belittle her, but as the world spirals towards war, she is headed for a crash course in danger and love.</p><p></p><h2>The Easter Story (Candle Bible for Kids)</h2><p><p>An easy-to-read retelling of the story of the first Easter, in a bright little book.

Alan Connor, a comic writer known for his exploration of all things crossword in <i>The Guardian</i>, covers every twist and turn: from the 1920s, when crosswords were considered a menace to productive society; to World War II, when they were used to recruit code breakers; to their starring role in a 2008 episode of&nbsp;<i>The Simpsons</i>.<br>&nbsp;<br>He also profiles the colorful characters who make up the interesting and bizarre subculture of crossword constructors and competitive solvers, including Will Shortz, the iconic <i>New York Times</i> puzzle editor who created a crafty crossword that appeared to predict the outcome of a presidential election, and the legions of competitive puzzle solvers who descend on a Connecticut hotel each year in an attempt to be crowned the American puzzle-solving champion.<br>&nbsp;<br>At a time when the printed word is in decline, Connor marvels at the crossword&#x2019;s seamless transition onto Kindles and iPads, keeping the puzzle one of America&#x2019;s favorite pastimes. He also explores the way the human brain processes crosswords versus computers that are largely stumped by clues that require wordplay or a simple grasp of humor.<br>&nbsp;<br>A fascinating examination of our most beloved linguistic amusement&#x2014;and filled with tantalizing crosswords and clues embedded in the text&#x2014;<i>The Crossword Century&nbsp;</i>is sure to attract the attention of the readers who made&nbsp;<i>Word Freak</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Just My Type</i>&nbsp;bestsellers.</p><p><b>Alan Connor</b> is an Oxford-educated writer, journalist, television producer, and academic. He lives in London where he writes a biweekly column for <i>The Guardian </i>on crosswords.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>This is a book about having FUN with words. And if you&#x2019;re wondering why that word is in capital letters, all will become clear.</p><p>And it&#x2019;s a very particular form of fun with words: one that involves jumbling and tumbling them into eye-pleasingly symmetrical patterns and making riddles, jokes, and poetry in the form of crossword clues. A love of crosswords is also a love of language&#x2014;albeit a love that enjoys seeing the object of its affections toyed with, tickled, and flipped upside down.</p><p>Crossword puzzles are a silly, playful way of taking English and making it into a game. They have been doing so since December 21, 1913, when the world&#x2019;s first crossword appeared&#x2014;although lovers of language had been deriving pleasure from wordplay long before then, of course. However, it was the crossword that came to supersede all other puzzles. It has become a cornerstone of almost all newspapers and, for many, a fondly anticipated daily appointment.</p><p>The crossword today looks quite different than that first puzzle&#x2014;or that should perhaps read &#x201c;crosswords today&#x201d; so as to encompass the baroque creations seen in Sunday papers, the strange mutant British form known as the cryptic, and all of the themed and jokey variants on offer on any given day.</p><p>What they have in common is the pleasure of identifying what the constructor is asking for and seeing the answers mesh with one another until the puzzle is finished. For a century, the worker has whiled away journeys and parents have passed on tips and tricks in the hope that each grid tackled will be correctly filled.</p><p>In The Crossword Century, we&#x2019;ll be looking at the playfulness, the humor, and the frustration of the crossword in all its forms, and how the world of the puzzle has overlapped with espionage and humor, current affairs and literature. We&#x2019;ll see fictional crossword encounters, from The West Wing to The Simpsons, and we&#x2019;ll see crosswords from the real world: the one that seemed to predict the outcome of a presidential election and the ones that appeared to be giving away the secrets of the Second World War.</p><p>We&#x2019;ll look at how clues tantalize those who are addicted to puzzles by sending the solver on wild-goose chases, by being sweetly silly and soberly serious, and by stubbornly withholding their real meanings until the penny drops.</p><p>And we ask questions about the experience of solving: Why do some people try to finish crosswords as quickly as possible? Can computers crack clues? And does puzzling really stave off dementia?</p><p>As for how to read this book, please feel free to treat it like a puzzle. That is to say, you can start at 1 across and work sequentially, or you can dive in and out and follow your instincts. The chapters are in two sections: The ACROSS entries look at the creation of puzzles and the strange things that can go on within clues and grids, while the DOWNs describe what happens to the crossword once it escapes into the world and meets its solvers.</p><p>Like the British man who created the first crossword in New York, we&#x2019;ll be crossing the Atlantic Ocean&#x2014;a few times, in fact&#x2014;and I humbly hope that along the way I might persuade you that the baffling-looking British cryptic is a lot more enjoyable than legend has it.</p><p>Are you ready for FUN?</p><p><b>PART ONE<br>ACROSS FALL IN A GARDEN, DEPICTED? GENESIS</b></p><p>How the crossword first appeared in 1913 and became an overnight sensation in 1924</p><p>Newsday&#x2019;s crossword editor puts it best. &#x201c;Liverpool&#x2019;s two greatest gifts to the world of popular culture,&#x201d; writes Stanley Newman, &#x201c;are the Beatles and Arthur Wynne.&#x201d;</p><p>The comparison with the Beatles is on the money&#x2014;or, to use a more British locution, spot-on. Like the music of the Fab Four, the crossword is a global phenomenon that is at once American and British. But while the Beatles are known wherever recorded music is played, Arthur Wynne&#x2019;s name remains unspoken by almost all. Who was he?</p><p>Well, he wasn&#x2019;t the Lennon or the McCartney of crosswords; we&#x2019;ll meet them soon enough. He was perhaps crosswords&#x2019; Fats Domino: a pioneer who would see his innovation taken by others to strange, often baroque mutant forms and variants.</p><p>Not that this was how Wynne saw his career playing out when he became one of the forty million people who emigrated from Europe between 1830 and 1930, and one of the nine million heading from Liverpool for the New World during that same period.</p><p>The son of the editor of The Liverpool Mercury, Wynne was&#x2014;at least initially, and in his own mind&#x2014;a journalist. He spent most of his newspaper career working for the empire of print mogul William Randolph Hearst. His legacy, though, was not a piece of reporting, and it appeared in the New York World, a Democrat-supporting daily published by Hearst&#x2019;s rival, Joseph Pulitzer.</p><p>As a kind of precursor to the New York Post, The World mixed sensation with investigation, and it was Wynne&#x2019;s job to add puzzles to the jokes and cartoons for &#x201c;Fun,&#x201d; the Sunday magazine section. He had messed around with tried-and-tested formats: word searches, mazes, anagrams, rebuses.</p></p><h2>Sail</h2><p>Since the death of her husband, Anne Dunne and her three children have struggled in every way. In a last ditch effort to save the family, Anne plans an elaborate sailing vacation to bring everyone together once again. But only an hour out of port, everything is going wrong. The teenage daughter, Carrie, is planning to drown herself. The teenage son, Mark, is high on drugs and ten-year-old Ernie is nearly catatonic. This is the worst vacation ever.<br>Anne manages to pull things together bit by bit, but just as they begin feeling like a family again, something catastrophic happens. Survival may be the least of their concerns. <br>Written with the blistering pace and shocking twists that only James Patterson can master, SAIL takes "Lost" and "Survivor" to a new level of terror.<i></i></p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Since his first novel won the Edgar Award in 1977 James Patterson's books have sold more than 300 million copies. He is the author of the Alex Cross novels<b>,</b> the most popular detective series of the past twenty-five years, including <i>Kiss the Girls </i>and <i>Along Came a Spider</i>. He writes full-time and lives in Florida with his family.<br>Katherine Dunne plans a sailing trip with her three kids as a way to bring them closer. But from the beginning, the trip is fraught with danger in the form of mechanical malfunctions, storms, and other seemingly random problems. Katherine and the children work together to overcome adversity on the seas. The suspenseful tone is captured well by the production&#39;s pair of narrators. Dylan Baker excels, in particular, with a snarky, whiny tone and a deeper, slightly raspy voice for the two evil plotters. Jennifer Van Dyck varies the pitches for Katherine&#39;s children. While the narrators do a fine job overall, the book&#39;s sole problem is an organizational one. Several characters are voiced at different times by each narrator. For consistency&#39;s sake, that could have been avoided. But it doesn&#39;t mar the listener&#39;s enjoyment.

Seeing compassion in this way, we lose out on experiencing the transformative potential of one of our most neglected inner resources.</p><p>Dr Lorne Ladner rescues compassion from this marginalised view, showing how its practical application in our life can be a powerful force in achieving happiness. Combining the wisdom of Tibetan Buddhism and Western psychology, Ladner presents clear, effective practices for cultivating compassion in daily living. </p></p><p>For modern Westerners groomed to be competitive, insatiable, and as hyperactive as hamsters, <i>The Lost Art of Compassion</i> stops us dead in our frantic tracks. With a zenlike whack to the side of our heads, Ladner deftly applies the pragmatic methods of Buddhism to psychology, reminding us that genuine happiness won't come from our misdirected striving and craving. A clinical psychologist and longtime Tibetan practitioner, Ladner has written a deeply innovative and kind how-to guide that reclaims the foundations of authentic contentment and compassion. The Western practice of psychology has taught us to work with damaging emotions and patterns, but according to Ladner has not offered "even one clear, practical, well-researched method for people to use to develop compassion." In contrast, the Buddhist tradition of mind-training focuses on the steady cultivation of positive emotions and mental states such as affection, even-mindedness, empathy, gratitude, and especially compassion. By practicing, we not only free ourselves from negative emotions, but are moved to ease the human suffering around us that is fed by such emotions. Richly combining his years of clinical and spiritual work, Ladner offers 10 reflective practices that drill out "the ego's calcifications" and distorting self images, opening the space for compassion. Emphasizing that "you cannot give others what you do not have yourself," his method gradually builds outward from establishing a secure self to caring for others. And, somehow, he does this without making us feel like we need to be Mother Teresa by next week. Ladner has never forgotten how he once heard someone in Los Angeles ask the Dalai Lama "what was the 'quickest and easiest' way to enlightenment." The Dalai Lama bowed his head and began to cry. Not fast-food, Ladner's book is a gift of compassion in itself once anyone puts it to practice. <i>--Deborah Easter</i><p>Lorne Ladner, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist in private practice near Washington, D.C., and an adjunct faculty member in the counseling program at Argosy University. Dr. Ladner is also center director at the Guhyasamaja Buddhist Center in Northern Virginia. He regularly teaches classes, conducts workshops, and leads meditation retreats.</p></p><h2>The Rise and Fall of Prussia</h2><p>Prussia, a state which contributed so much to European civilization, only exis-ted as an independent power for 170 years. Sebastian Haffner, a Prussian by birth, reassesses the legend and tells the short but dramatic history of this unique state. He casts fresh light on its foundation, its struggle to become a great power in the eighteenth century, its important role as one of the Three Black Eagles with Austria and Russia, and its eventual disappearance from the map of Europe after the establishment of the German Empire.</p><p>Sebastian Haffner was born in 1907 in Berlin. He emigrated to England in 1938 and wrote for the OBSERVER for many years. He returned to Germany in 1954, where he became a prominent journalist and historian, writing for DIE WELT and STERN. He died in 1999.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy (Univocal)</h2><p><p><br>Each generation invents new practices and new writings of philosophy. Ours should have been able to introduce certain mutations that would at least be equivalent with those of cubism, abstract art, and twelve-tone serialism: it has only partially done so. But after all the deconstructions, after Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and Derrida, this demand takes on a different dimension: What do we do with philosophy itself? How do we globally change our relation to this thought, which keeps indicating that it is increasingly conservative and repetitive? These two questions together have prompted what we call &#x201c;non-philosophy.&#x201d;</p><br><p>Non-philosophy is not the negation of philosophy. It is the suspension of philosophy&#x2019;s claim to think the real (Principle of Sufficient Philosophy), and it is the invention of new usages of thought and language that disrupt the rational narrative of the real, which is precisely what every philosophy is. Non-philosophy should rather be understood � la the &#x201c;non-Euclidean,&#x201d; namely, as a generalization of the philosophical beyond its traditional limitation by the unitary or &#x201c;Heraclitean&#x201d; postulate. From then on, an infinite number of philosophical decisions that are no longer mutually exclusive will correspond with any real phenomenon. </p><br><p><i>Philosophy and Non-Philosophy</i> is widely considered the first fully explicit elaboration of non-philosophy and one of its most important introductory texts.<br></p></p><p><p><br>Fran�ois Laruelle is professor emeritus at the University of Paris West Nanterre La D�fence and the inventor of the science of philosophy, non-philosophy.<br></p></p><h2>Naruto: Chapter Book, Vol. 4: The Secret Plan (4) (Naruto: Chapter Books)</h2><p>Naruto and his new ninja friends have been trying to play bodyguard to weird old Mr. Tazuna as they battle the evil Zabuza, the Demon of the Mist.

But what is Zabuza&#x2019;s secret plan?!</p><p>Naruto is a ninja-in-training with a need for attention, a knack for mischief and, sealed within him, a strange, formidable power.

And editor Turner deserves praise for including several stories by women authors; in fact, two standouts are Laurie Colwin's poignant "My Mistress" and Bharati Mukherjee's electric "The Middle Man." Two long pieces--Nelson Algren's take on Depression-era carnival life, "The Last Carousel," and Norman Mailer's bizarre tale of black masses and Joan of Arc, "Trail of the Warlock"--are balanced by stories with traditional O. Henry-style endings, such as Roald Dahl's chilling "A Fine Son," Thomas McGuane's blunt "Like a Leaf," Bernard Malamud's wise "Naked Nude," and T. Coraghessan Boyle's funny-sad "Modern Love." There's even a laugh-out-loud "lost" segment of <i>Catch-22</i>, in which Joseph Heller's Yossarian determines baseball and basketball to be the stupidest sports ever invented. Glittering entries from Nabokov, Gabriel Garc{�}ia M{&nbsp;}arquez, Isaac Bashevis Singer, James Baldwin, and Haruki Murakami round out the <i>A</i> list, with fascinating oddball curios like Jack Kerouac's "Good Blonde," Robert Coover's bizarre "Lucky Pierre in the Doctor's Office," and John Gardner's frightening "Julius Caesar and the Werewolf" putting the finishing touches on a grand collection. <i>Joe Collins</i>That Playboy has always showcased first-rate mainstream fiction is evident from this superlative anthology of stories by Bernard Malamud, Norman Mailer, Jack Kerouac, Andre Dubus, Jorge Luis Borges, Thomas McGuane, John Cheever, James Baldwin, Isaac Bashevis Singer and others. Sex, when it occurs here, is often an arena of hazard or negotiation, as in Paul Theroux's prickly tale of a wealthy young Bostonian out for erotic adventure in Africa; or T. Coraghessan Boyle's ultimate satire of safe sex featuring an obsessive magazine editor who insists that her lover wear a full-body condom. Another human constant, death, pervades John Updike's account of smug tourists visiting an Egyptian necropolis and Vladimir Nabokov's witty tale of a seduction on a train. Women, though a decided minority, are represented by Joyce Carol Oates's withering portrait of American academics transplanted to Canada amid the 1960s counterculture; Nadine Gordimer's powerful tale of an Afrikaner farmer's disposal of the corpse of a black man; Laurie Colwin's disarmingly direct narrative of an adulterer; and pieces by Shirley Jackson, Bharati Mukherjee and Ursula LeGuin. Playboy fiction editor Turner has pulled together a smart anthology that constantly entertains and provokes. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Edge of the Anvil: Resource Book for the Blacksmith</h2><p>An introduction to blacksmithing, illustrated with line drawings and photographs, that takes the reader through all the main processes of blacksmithing including tools and equipment, lighting a fire, welding, splitting, and decorative iron work.</p><p></p><h2>The Poppy Seeds</h2><p>A young boy&#39;s attempts to grow poppies in his drought parched village soften the heart of the grouchy old man who has the village&#39;s only spring in his back yard</p><p></p><h2>Louisiana Breakdown</h2><p>&#34;Welcome to Grail, Louisiana�next to nothing and just beyond reality�where hoodoo meets Jesus, and townsfolk pray to both.

Vida Dumars, owner of the Moonlight Diner, peers into the deepest realms of her customers&#39; hearts as though they were picture windows. Town spirit Good Gray Man has promised good fortune to the town as long as it hangs onto tradition.

He lives in Vancouver, Washington.A lethargic Louisiana backwater with roots sunk deep in supernatural legend provides an atmospheric backdrop for this sultry tale of bayou hoodoo and doomed love. Every 20 years, in obeisance to a local myth dubbed the Good Gray Man, the town of Grail picks a Midsummer Queen whose job is to draw all the bad luck to her so the town can prosper. Enter Jack Mustaine, a wandering musician stranded in Grail just a few days before the end of Vida Dumar's tenure as the reigning queen. Jack sees the alluring Vida as a muse and mate who might inspire his songs with a spark of passion. Vida sees Jack as her deliverer from a reputation as the town pariah and from a diabolical ex-lover who bedevils her with weird sendings. As Jack and Vida pair to find the shared sensibilities that will give them strength, St. John's Eve and the festival of the Midsummer Queen approach with the grim inevitability of Shirley Jackson's lottery. As always, Shepard's (Colonel Rutherford's Colt) forte is his characters, whose emotional lives are invariably more complex and credible than the basic plot he crafts to draw them out. Jack and Vida make an affectingly tragic couple trapped in a preordained fate, but equally intriguing is the chorus of well-drawn locals, whose every gesture and casual word convey a sense of the foreboding and intractable. Laced with sex, superstition and sorcery and illustrated with J.K. Potter photomontages that effectively capture its shadowy magic, this short novel is sure to please Shepard's fans and lovers of dark fantasy fiction.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chinese Animal Painting Made Easy</h2><p>A complete guide to painting pandas, horses, elephants, and 47 other beloved creatures in the traditional Chinese brush-style.

Which is why having to play second base feels like demotion to second team. Yet that?s where Hutch ends up after Darryl ?D-Will? Williams, the best shortstop prospect since A-Rod, joins the team. But Hutch is nothing if not a team player, and he?s cool with playing in D-Will?s shadow?until, that is, the two shortstops in Hutch?s life betray him in a way he never could have imagined. With the league championship on the line, just how far is Hutch willing to bend to be a good teammate?<br><br></p><p>For Hutch, shortstop has always been home. It's where his father once played professionally, before injuries relegated him to watching games on TV instead of playing them. And it's where Hutch himself has always played and starred. Until now. The arrival of Darryl "D-Will" Williams, the top shortstop prospect from Florida since A-Rod, means Hutch is displaced, in more ways than one. Second base feels like second fiddle, and when he sees his father giving fielding tips to D-Will--the same father who can't be bothered to show up to watch his son play--Hutch feels betrayed. With the summer league championship on the line, just how far is Hutch willing to bend to be a good teammate?<p> Mike Lupica returns to the big field for the first time since his #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>Heat</i> and delivers a feel-good home run, showing how love of the game is a language fathers and sons speak from the heart. </p> <p> <strong>Q&amp;A with Mike Lupica</strong> </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Where did the idea for <i>The Big Field</i> come from? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> If it has one starting point, it was when Alex Rodriguez came to the Yankees and left shortstop to play third base. It wasn't so much that Rodriguez was the best all-around player in baseball at the time. It was that I knew he'd always thought of himself as a shortstop. I'm not sure he still doesn't think of himself as a shortstop. And suddenly he was a third baseman. Hutch isn't the best player in this book; Darryl Williams is. But Hutch had been a shortstop his whole life, it defined him as a ballplayer, and now because of the presence of Darryl on their American Legion team, he has to go to second base. It's the starting off point in a book that is ultimately about fathers and sons. But it's about a player having to leave his best position for the good of his team. </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> In <i>The Big Field</i>, the emotional heart of the story is Keith "Hutch" Hutchinson's relationship with his father, a washed-up ballplayer and former boy phenomenon who never advanced past the minor leagues and who completely soured on the game, setting the stage for a distant relationship with his son. Why did you decide to focus on the father-son dynamic in this novel? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> Sometimes with fathers and sons, when they can't communicate, they fall back on sports. It is like some universal language for fathers and sons. But at the start of <i>The Big Field</i>, Hutch and his dad don't even have that. And their journey, both of them, and I think it's a great journey, is finding that language again, finding a bond they never really lost. And finding each other. </p><p><strong>Q:</strong> Can you offer any advice for aspiring sports writers? </p><p><strong>A:</strong> Read the best guys, in books and newspapers and magazines. And then find ways to write. Write for the school paper, write anywhere you can, but write. I believe strongly that if you have the talent and the spirit, somebody will find you. </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> When writing a young character do you find yourself looking back to yourself at that age? Or your children? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> I look back to myself, and remember how important sports were to me, the fellowship, just the sheer fun of having a game with my buddies even if it wasn't organized. I tell people all the time that I still go to games thinking I might see something I've never seen before. I still have that feeling. But more than that, I see sports through the eyes of my children, too. See what they think is good, or cool, or worth watching. See what excites them. They've made me smarter about sports, they really have. But then that always happens when you hang around smart people. </p><p> <strong>Q:</strong> Have you started working on your next book? Can you give us a sneak peak? </p><p> <strong>A:</strong> My next book is already finished. It's about a young foster child, and his love for baseball. He's a catcher. And I think you're going to like him. The book is called "Safe at Home." The book I'm writing right now is my first soccer book. That's all I'm going to tell you! </p>Mike Lupica lives in Connecticut.</p><h2>Sacred Texts of the World: A Universal Anthology</h2><p>A perennial best-seller, this collection of readings remains a favorite of teachers of world religions for its impartial tone and its balance of major contemporary religious traditions with primitive, ancient, and esoteric religions.</p><p>The late Ninian Smart was a distinguished academic theologian who founded the UK&#39;s first major department of Religious Studies at the University of Lancaster.

A squire serves and learns from a seasoned knight for four years, then faces a final test. That final test is the Ordeal, which takes place in a magical room called the Chamber. There, a squire encounters the parts of him or herself that the Chamber deems to be the most difficult to face&#x2013;be they fears, failings, or unrepented wicked deeds. Does Kel have what it takes to survive?<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>In Book 3 of Tamora Pierce's <i>Protector of the Small</i> sequence, 14-year-old Keladry of Mindelan is ready to begin training as a squire after undergoing four grueling years as the first girl to be officially educated as a page. Disappointed at first that Lady Alanna (whom we first met in the Song of the Lioness Quartet series) does not choose her, Kel is delighted when gruff, good-natured, down-to-earth Lord Raoul takes her on. The next four years prove to be tough but happy, for the most part, as Raoul and most of the others in the King's Own (a corps of 300 men--299 now, plus Kel--that enforces the law and helps local nobles deal with problems such as centaur attacks and forest robberies) treat Kel as an equal. Throughout, Kel is physically and mentally preparing herself for the final test in the Chamber of the Ordeal, in which fourth-year squires must successfully face their greatest fears before becoming knights.<p> In this sequel to <i>First Test: Protector of the Small</i> and <i>Page: Protector of the Small</i>, Kel continues to be an admirable role model: stoutly loyal, strong, independent, honest, yet very real in her fears and weaknesses. Romance lurks for the budding adolescent as she develops a crush on one fellow and begins a sweet kissing-only relationship with another, after a very frank discussion about sex with her mother. Although the buildup to the Ordeal is watered down a bit by Kel's periodic visits to the Chamber door for a taste of what's to come, overall, this latest in Pierce's series is a rousing tale of chivalry and heroism that any reader will be sorely challenged to put down.

Illustrated by David Wojtowycz in full colour.</p><p>Giles Andreae is the author of some of Orchard&#39;s bestselling picture books. David Wojtowycz has teamed up with Giles time and time again, always with enormous success. Their titles, The Lion Who Wanted to Love won the Children&#39;s Book Award and Commotion in the Ocean was shortlisted for the Nottingham Children&#39;s Book Award. Another of Giles&#39;s titles Giraffes Can&#39;t Dance was commended in the Sheffield Children&#39;s Book Award.PreS. A collection of poems about animals and a story about a journey through the jungle to hunt for them. The search begins as a small group of ants marches off from their hill early in the morning. A verse then introduces each creature as encountered, until the end of the day when all of the animals are ready to sleep. As an added bonus, each poem gives a little information about the animal described. A nice rhythm is established and maintained. An occasional line is awkward, but overall the book reads well. The illustrations are equally playful and eye-catching. Done in oils, each one is bright, bold, and inviting, but totters on the brink of being cute. Large, double-page spreads make the animals easily seen from a distance, but children who view the pictures up close will delight in finding some of the ants on each page. An entertaining selection with lively illustrations and a format suitable for storytimes.?Dawn Ibey, Vancouver Public Library, Canada<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>A Green and Ancient Light</h2><p>A gorgeous fantasy in the spirit of <i>Pan&#x2019;s Labyrinth</i> and John Connolly&#x2019;s <i>The Book of Lost Things.</i><br><br>Set in a world similar to our own, during a war that parallels World War II, <i>A Green and Ancient Light</i> is the stunning story of a boy who is sent to stay with his grandmother for the summer in a serene fishing village.

Durbin is a writer and novelist of fantasy and horror. His first novel, <i>Dragonfly</i>, was published by Arkham House in 1999. It was nominated for an International Horror Guild Award for Best First Novel.A Green and Ancient Light <br> <br>I<br> <br>remember the plane hurtling above the village. It left a trail of thick gray smoke, and its engine roared and coughed. Grandmother and I were working in the garden, digging potatoes. We could see the plane was an enemy ?ghter, part of the squadron we&#x2019;d heard earlier as it growled north, heading up the coast. Now alone, skimming the mountain slopes, the plane dove toward us like a sorrowful, stricken angel. I was on my feet by the time it careened right over our heads. Its shadow made the sun above me blink.<br> <br>Grandmother uttered a reproachful sound, her digging-fork across her knees as she tipped back her hard brown face, shielding her eyes from the glare. She didn&#x2019;t spring to her feet as I did. Nothing about the war ever made Grandmother dash to the window or pace the ?oor or otherwise put herself out. She didn&#x2019;t watch caravans, and she pretended not to listen to bulletins on the radio; she clucked her tongue when they interrupted the orchestra broadcasts, though she never actually switched them off. But neither did she stop snapping beans or darning socks. And I never saw anyone draw her into speculation on how things were going for the troops.<br> <br>We could see the enemy insignia on the wings, and a row of bullet holes ran the length of the fuselage. There was an �explosion; black smoke billowed. The engine sputtered out entirely, and ?ames rolled back over the cockpit. I dashed to the corner of the house to continue watching. With an eerie silence, the plane cleared the orchards and the front street; it missed the ?shing boats in the green harbor, and it missed the rocks. Out where the sea deepened to blue, it smashed into the waves, throwing up a tower of spray.<br> <br>I turned to look at Grandmother. My eyes must have been wide, and I think my mouth was open. My feet were tugging me into the side yard. Grandmother began scratching in the soil again, with a little grunt that meant, &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s that.&#x201d;<br> <br>But seeing that my knees wouldn&#x2019;t bend, my feet wouldn&#x2019;t be still, she said, &#x201c;Go on, then. Run down and see.&#x201d; There was no disapproval in her tone. She was talking to a nine-year-old boy for whom a great many things were intriguing: moths on the screen, moss, the squirming life beneath rotted logs, and planes that fell from the sky.<br> <br>Quite a crowd had gathered on the front street: people on �bicycles, ?shermen knee-deep in piles of nets, three sisters from the abbey clutching their rosaries and looking paler than usual&#x2014;and of course children from near and far, wriggling over fences, pounding along the dusty lanes&#x2014;everyone pointing and talking at once.<br> <br>&#x201c;It exploded,&#x201d; someone said. Indeed, a last, thick plume of black smoke hovered over the waves, at the end of the gray swath across the sky. &#x201c;I thought it was coming right down on the street!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Rattled the cans on the shelves,&#x201d; said Mr. B &#x2014;&#x2014;, the grocer. He had white hair and black sideburns, which seemed to me the opposite of how most men&#x2019;s hair turned white.<br> <br>&#x201c;Woke me up from a nap,&#x201d; said someone else. &#x201c;I was sure they were dive-bombing the cannery!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t like it this close. Don&#x2019;t like it at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing left of that plane. Went straight to the bottom, I guess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a goner. That&#x2019;s no way to die, theirs or ours.&#x201d;<br> <br>A woman in a green print dress kept smoothing her hair, as if the wind from the warbird&#x2019;s passing had left her in hopeless dis�array. Two boys jabbered about how they&#x2019;d thought the plane would hit the boats. They glanced at me but were more interested in the plane for now; children in the village generally seemed curious about me, but we rarely crossed paths&#x2014;boys my age kept busy helping their elders on the docks or in the vegetable gardens, and I wasn&#x2019;t out of the cottage in the evenings when they might have been free. I wasn&#x2019;t opposed to making friends here, but mostly I missed my two closest friends back home.<br> <br>The wind picked up, scattering the smoke. A little yellow dog ran through the crowd, barking and wagging its curly tail.<br> <br>Climbing over the low stone wall, I stepped out of my battered shoes and padded across the wet sand, right to the water&#x2019;s edge between piers. At this end of the village, the land sloped down gently to the shore, and there were no cliffs. The sea-smell washed over me, huge and ?shy and humid, with that dank hint of all that it hid, ancient wrecks and monsters that made whales look like minnows. Gulls screeched, riding the wind currents. Beside me, a tiny crab scuttled across a rock, and a raisin box bobbed, its sides puckered and bleached nearly white. Sand oozed between my toes; a wave rolled in, and soon my pant legs were drenched to the knees.<br> <br>I could look right out through the harbor mouth to where the plane had gone down. There was not a sign of it now. Only the waves rose and fell, their edges dazzling in the light.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I won&#x2019;t tell you my name or that of the village where I spent that spring and summer when I was nine. I won&#x2019;t because you should realize there were towns just like it and boys just like me all around the sea&#x2014;and in other countries beyond the mountains, and all over the world. We awoke in our nights to the growl of trucks, the barking of loudspeakers. (I was one of the fortunate, for whom the guns were a rumble in the distance.) The men in our families were soldiers now, regardless of what they&#x2019;d been before; many were already dead. The women worked in factories, in hospitals, or stayed at home to care for the very young.<br> <br>And then there were those like me: too old to be carried about, too young to work or ?ght. We were sent off to the countryside where no one thought bombs would fall. We came to know our relatives, old people who had known our parents in another time. In my case, it was only for the late spring and summer, while my mother was getting used to a new job and my baby sister was a newborn. (Schooling in those years was haphazard. Sirens interrupted classes. High-school boys went to war, and classrooms became factories where girls sewed. A season later, my elementary school closed entirely for two years.) I might have been of consider�able help to my mother; I was old enough for that. But my father felt strongly that it was time I got to know my grandmother.<br> <br>It is a strange thing to spend your days with a person connected to you only by the link of someone you both hold dear, but the young one they knew is not quite the same as the older one you know. It&#x2019;s like talking to someone through a hedge. Now and then, you see an outline, the edge of a face between leaves. You can only walk along in search of a gate.<br> <br>On the table beside my bed at Grandmother&#x2019;s cottage, I kept a framed photo of the four of us: my papa in his Army captain&#x2019;s uniform, his eyes alight with kindness, one arm around my mama and one hand on my shoulder; my mama, cradling my newborn sister, holding her so that her little face showed, Mama&#x2019;s face inclined as if she&#x2019;d only just managed to turn her gaze toward the camera as the shutter opened. And there I was, looking uncomfortable in my school coat and tie, my hair sticking up though my mama had just combed it down. I looked at the picture so much that spring and summer that I knew every shadow in it, every wrinkle of clothing; I could see our faces when I wasn&#x2019;t looking at it. In the picture, both my parents were smiling as if there were no cares in the world.<br> <br>I loved the letters Mama sent me here, warm and full of the hugs and kisses that embarrassed me in public but that I was glad for in writing. She would give me reports on the castle&#x2014;Papa and I had built a castle out of wood, complete with turrets and a drawbridge, and I had painted it all; it sat on a table in my room but was too big and delicate to bring here. So, my mother would write to me about the weather over the castle, about the feasts they were having in the great hall. She tried to tell me about the knights and their quests, but she didn&#x2019;t understand that part very well. It was all right. I was always happy to hear that the King and Queen were well, that no enemies had invaded. I wrote back to her and to my father, though I knew it took longer for mail to reach him. Grandmother didn&#x2019;t read the letters I wrote or the ones I received. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your business,&#x201d; she said, which was a new arrangement for me, that I might have &#x201c;business&#x201d; apart from that of the grown-ups around me. She taught me once what to say at the post of?ce, showed me the jar where I could ?nd coins for posting letters, and after that, I was on my own.<br> <br>I missed my parents, but I had stopped crying for them in the dark hours. After a few weeks in the village, our city began to feel like a distant dream. I knew it was real, that if I rode the train again, it would be there, and its bricks would become the reality once more, and this village would be the dream. One person, I&#x2019;d come to understand, was actually many people&#x2014;people of different ages, people who lived in different surroundings; these people all had the same name and knew something of each other, but they lived entirely separate lives.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>It was a wondrous village Grandmother lived in. I was used to straight, level streets, advertising signs and honking cars, puddles and dodging bicycles and people who hurried along with blank faces. There was more sun in Grandmother&#x2019;s village, and ordinary life seemed half like a festival. People stopped to talk when they met, setting down their shopping baskets. There were benches everywhere that seemed placed for this purpose, often roofed by trellises of ?owering vines. Many shops had open fronts all day, the wares spilling out and piled in the street.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d never seen streets like these! They wandered as if a great wave had washed up through the village, its water coursing among the buildings, ?nding a thousand ways eventually back to the sea; and these runnels had left magical sand that had hardened into cobbles, ?int paths, and lanes of hard-packed earth. At its end farthest from Grandmother&#x2019;s house, half of the village climbed a cliff, so the streets there would turn without warning into steep stairways. There were no posted names, no numbers on doors or lanes. People would emerge from gates beneath ceilings of vines, from doors set right into the rock, and I always wanted to crane my neck and peer past them, sure I might glimpse stairs winding down to kingdoms under the ground where the light came from jewels in the walls.<br> <br>Down at the cliff &#x2019;s foot, the sea had carved out high-rimmed basins and caves where the waves rushed in through narrow mouths, ?ooding the rocks with surges of foam. Grandmother had led me there in the ?rst week, and we&#x2019;d watched the scurrying crabs, our faces wet with spray, our ears half-deafened by the sea&#x2019;s roaring. &#x201c;People have drowned here,&#x201d; Grandmother yelled beside me, her grip ?erce on my arm. &#x201c;Do not ever come back here alone. Do you understand?&#x201d; I nodded, sensing how important it was to her. She&#x2019;d wanted to show me these merciless sea-basins before I discovered them on my own.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>A day or two after the trip to the cliff &#x2019;s foot, I learned Grand�mother&#x2019;s other sacred commandment, but this one she didn&#x2019;t warn me about. It happened like this.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d made my ?rst trip alone to the post of?ce, mailed letters to both my parents, and was feeling quite happy with myself as I returned toward her cottage down the main street, which at our end of the village was wide and mostly straight. I kicked a series of pebbles, overtaking one and kicking it ahead of me until it bounced too far aside, then choosing another. As I admired the dense, round tops of some orchard trees, I came alongside Mrs. D &#x2014;&#x2014;, whom I knew to be Grandmother&#x2019;s friend. Mrs. D &#x2014;&#x2014; had a round face like a china plate and small, sparkly eyes. She laughed pleasantly and often, and she had a way of asking one question after another, so that you could get only about half an answer in for each question and you wondered whether she was even listening. As I got near Mrs. D &#x2014;&#x2014;, I saw that she was carry�ing her wicker basket from the shops and a parcel besides, and remembering my manners, I offered to carry them for her. She lived not far from Grandmother&#x2019;s, and on the way.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a gentleman you are!&#x201d; she exclaimed, gladly handing them over. They were both quite heavy. &#x201c;Just like your father. Oh, he was a ?ne boy, and he is a ?ne man, and it&#x2019;s no accident, because you come from ?ne stock!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; I said. I&#x2019;d only ever heard &#x201c;stock&#x201d; in reference to cows, and I wondered how it was that our family had come from cows, or what exactly Mrs. D &#x2014;&#x2014; meant.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you settling in? It must be so different for you here, so quiet, and none of your friends about, just us old folks, and our funny ways, our speaking&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the sea-speech. We sound like the gulls, I suppose, like the waves all rolling, one into another. Mumbling like the ocean. The city-folk say they can&#x2019;t make pails or pitchers out of what we say. Can you understand the people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I said, supposing that a &#x201c;Yes&#x201d; answered more of her questions than it didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;And as smart as white gloves!&#x201d; she cried proudly, patting my shoulder as if I&#x2019;d won the races. &#x201c;But of course you would be a smart one, your father&#x2019;s son, and M &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2019;s grandson. Sharp as shears, the whole family! I must tell you, I&#x2019;m honored to call your grandmother a friend! And a wonderful friend she&#x2019;s always been.&#x201d;<br> <br>I nodded and smiled, readjusting the parcel.<br> <br>&#x201c;But how about you; I want to know more about you! What do you like about our village? Aren&#x2019;t the ?owers pretty? We take great care with our ?owers! &#x2018;You can grow them beautiful only if the heart has good soil&#x2019;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what we say!&#x201d;<br> <br>She paused expectantly, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to answer. I wasn&#x2019;t entirely convinced the question had much to do with me at all.<br> <br>&#x201c;The ?owers are very pretty,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And I love the trees. The mountains&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all so green. It&#x2019;s like the woods go on forever.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mrs. D &#x2014;&#x2014; looked taken aback, which surprised me. &#x201c;H&#x2019;m. Well, yes. The woods go on, but they&#x2019;re no place to be. There are wild animals, and worse things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Worse things?&#x201d; I was suddenly much more interested.<br> <br>Her sparkly eyes looked away from me, up toward the endless ranks of the treetops on the mountainsides. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure your grandmother doesn&#x2019;t want you going up there, and she&#x2019;d be a fair sight better than me at telling you. But it&#x2019;s best not even to think very loud about the forest. Where the sun doesn&#x2019;t go and the salt breeze can&#x2019;t blow away the cobwebs, no good can happen, and that&#x2019;s a fact.

Grandmother&#x2019;s caution made perfect sense to me, but I believed the best of trees.

To mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of Model&#39;s death in 1983, Aperture is reissuing this classic, highly collectible 1979 monograph--the first book ever published on Model--in the original oversized trim and with the original distinctive design by Marvin Israel, along with an updated chronology and bibliography. This timeless volume contains more than 50 of Model&#39;s greatest images, from the rich idlers on the Promenade des Anglais in the South of France to the sad, funny and often eccentric inhabitants of New York&#39;s most subterranean haunts. As Berenice Abbott said in her preface, &#34;One of the first reactions when looking at Model&#39;s pictures is that they make you feel good. You recognize them as real because real people express a bit of the universal humanity in all of us.&#34;</p><p>Lisette Model was born in Vienna and spent several years in Paris before moving to New York in 1938. Three years later she began a twelve-year association with Harper&#x2019;s Bazaar as a freelance photographer. Starting in 1951, she also taught at the New School for Social Research and in private classes and workshops."With just a glimpse, it's easy to see Model's influence, not only on her students like Larry Fink and Diane Arbus, but also on the direction of the medium of photography." -- Jay Gardner --Picture Magazine<br><br>"The Aperture Monograph of Lisette Model's collected works is definitely worth getting your hands on even if you are uninterested by landmarks in photographic history (Diane Arbus ranks as one of Model's more famous students) for one outstanding reason: after flipping through the book once, the deep gulf between the multiple subjects that are representative of her later works will seep into your conscious mind. Suddenly every street corner is full of individuals, caught up in their own internal worlds, the city watching over them curiously and commenting with the odd juxtaposition of a window dressing or a sculpted stone hand." -- Audrey Kobayashi --Tokion Magazine<br><br>"...Model found art everywhere, her vision unflinching and uniquely her own. She was concerned with the real." -- Shawn O'Sullivan --B&amp;W: Black and White Magazine</p><h2>Onions Etcetera: The Essential Allium Cookbook</h2><p><p><b><i>Onions Etcetera</i> features more than 130 supermarket-friendly recipes, all from the&nbsp;indispensable allium family: leeks, chives, garlic, shallots, scallions, and every other type&nbsp;of onion!<br><br><i>"I don&#x2019;t believe there is a single recipe in this book I don&#x2019;t want to cook." - Nigella Lawson</i></b><br><br> Whether you delight in the hunt for scapes, your favorite heirloom cipollini,&nbsp;the spice of raw garlic, or the sweetness of caramelized onions, <i>Onions Etcetera</i>&nbsp;is right place for you.<br><br> This book is for all the&nbsp;Allium&nbsp;lovers out there; all of you out there who&nbsp;can&#x2019;t imagine cooking dinner without <b>at least one&nbsp;onion in the mix</b>.&nbsp;In <i>Onions Etcetera</i>&nbsp;you&#x2019;ll explore the wonderful <b>versatility of the humble onion</b> as you learn to&nbsp;coax&nbsp;out flavors familiar and unknown.<br><br> From classics and family favorites, to more obscure recipes, you&#x2019;ll find <b>130 onion-centric dishes</b>, including:</p><ul><li>Za&#x2019;atar Onion Petals with Beets and Labneh</li><li>Pearl Onion Tarte Tatin</li><li>Appalachian Chimichurri</li><li>Curried Onion Fritters with Mint Raita</li><li>Grilled Delicata Squash with Shallot Agrodolce</li><li>Cheese and Allium Toasties</li><li>Eggplant Salad with Black Garlic Tahini Dressing</li><li>Scallion Sesame Pancakes</li><li>Grilled Fish with Charred Garlic Scape Relish</li></ul>And that's just a start, fellow onion lovers.

Seriously." - Nadxi Nieto, <em>Electric Literature</em><br><br>"...it's the art that elevates it into exceptional territory; appropriately lush, splendidly intricate sequences - each page gorgeously psychedelic with much to pore over." - Zainab Akhtar, <em>Comics &amp; Cola</em><br><br>"Jacobs' book is not only a weird and whimsical visual treat, but an example of equally strong storytelling that holds its own, elevating it way above your typical 'art comic.'" - Whit Taylor<br><br>"Part jungle adventure, part "psychedelic sojourn", part biblical allegory, part gender study, part contemporary commentary, <em>Safari Honeymoon</em> is much more than the sum of its parts; it becomes its own thing by being unlike almost anything else." - Daniel Elkin, <em>Your Chicken Enemy</em><br><br>"Like the characters, the reader is pulled deeper and deeper into the terrain as Jacobs reveals more of this land's hidden secrets. This makes for an especially enchanting read, even during the moments of grotesque horror." - Oliver Sava, <em>A.V.

[he] is a cartoonist gifted with tremendous imagination and one-of-a-kind visual acumen." - Rob Kirby, <em>The Comics Journal</em><br><br>"The work of an ingenious and fertile imagination this is a book where visual execution is unashamedly at the forefront of narrative drive in immersing the reader in a most intricately constructed realm of weirdness." - Andy Oliver, <em>Broken Frontier</em><br><br>"<em>Safari Honeymoon</em> is Summer 2014's sleeper hit of acid." - Greg Mannix, <em>End of the Universe</em><br><br>"When reading Jesse Jacobs' <em>Safari Honeymoon </em>the primary feeling is one of total immersion. It's not just a graphic novel about a newlywed couple taking their honeymoon in a strange, dangerous environment, it's a sensory experience that engulfs the reader in an intricately detailed biosystem of horrific parasites, alien foliage, and geometric spirits." - Oliver Sava, <em>A.V. Club</em><br><br>"In a recent interview, Jacobs said that if he weren't a cartoonist he would probably have been a farmer. With <em>Safari Honeymoon</em> it seems that Jacobs has managed to be both at once, albeit a farmer in which the reader is the field to be planted." - Jared Gardner, Ohio State University Professor of English and Film, <em>Public Books</em><br><br>"Prime strange amusement." - Ray Olson, <em>Booklist</em><br><br>"In a recent interview, Jacobs said that if he weren't a cartoonist he would probably have been a farmer.

But the artist's concern with the squishy, tactile processes of mutation, infection, and evolution goes beyond what animation captures of life, and gestures instead toward the natural world in all its bewildering complexity." - Sean Rogers, <em>The Globe and Mail</em><br><br>"Jesse Jacobs' last graphic novel-<em>By This You Shall Know Him</em>-is probably one of my top 5 favorite comics of the past half decade, making his latest-<em>Safari Honeymoon</em>-one of the books I've been most anticipating this year. His comics are weird, smart, beautifully designed and always surprising." - Rich Barrett, <em>mental_floss</em><br><br>"Part jungle adventure, part "psychedelic sojourn", part biblical allegory, part gender study, part contemporary commentary, <em>Safari Honeymoon</em> is much more than the sum of its parts; it becomes its own thing by being unlike almost anything else." - Daniel Elkin, <em>Comics Bulletin</em> <br><br>"<em>Safari Honeymoon</em>, as an exemplar of the next generation of comics storytelling, takes the medium to a different place, a place that may be best analogous to poetry." - Jason Sacks, <em>Comics Bulletin</em><br><br>"An exciting work for anyone interested in comics form and the medium's possibilities, it rewards multiple readings and close analysis...for me, it's one of the best graphic novels to come along in years. I couldn't recommend it more enthusiastically." - Ken Parille, <em>The Comics Journal</em><br><br>"My favourite of Jesse Jacobs' books, and another treasured addition to my Koyama Press shelf." - Camilla Barboza, Orbital Comics<br><br>"It's not a matter of whether you'll get it or not; Jacobs has once again put together beautiful work that's worthwhile, and so unique that it will have you talking for quite some time. Seriously, you won't find anything else like it out this year." - Ollie Ottoman, <em>Ground Control Magazine</em><br><br>"The best thing about my reading of <em>Safari Honeymoon</em> is how frequently I was surprised. For instance, the relationship between the couple is portrayed sweetly rather than cynically; they seem a pair of mismatched souls working through elements common to all of our engagements with others that rarely get explored: choice, inexplicable desire, awe, gratitude, grace. I'll buy that ticket anytime it's offered." - Tom Spurgeon, <em>The Comics Reporter</em><br><br>"Jesse Jacobs' work here accentuates everything that comics are great at, and serves as a perfect example of what the comics medium can really achieve that no other medium can in quite the same way." - John Seven, <em>Damnopedia</em><br><br>"Jacobs subverts jungle fantasy tropes by presenting just how precarious life is in the wild without the virtue of a total technological advantage and details that the only way out is to understand how the dominant species manages to adapt." - Rob Clough, <em>High-Low</em><br><br>"The writer and artist, Jesse Jacobs, has a history of the delightfully weird through his work on the cartoon <em>Adventure Time</em>, so didn't we expect him to toy with our perceptions of reality? And if there hadn't been strange creatures, comics would have felt left out." - Hannah Means-Shannon, <em>Bleeding Cool</em><br><br><strong>Praise for <em>By This Shall You Know Him</em></strong><br><br>"An art comics creation myth, cosmic, disturbing, and beautifully rendered in ice-blue and contrasting purples, with a style that welds the lovely to the grotesque...<em>By This Shall You Know Him</em> is (further) proof that fantasy in comics need not be hollow, generic, or ingratiating. It can be troubling instead. An inspired comic!" - Author and academic, Charles Hatfield (<em>Alternative Comics</em>, and <em>Hand of Fire: The Comics Art of Jack Kirby</em> University Press of Mississippi, 2005 and 2012)<br><br>"I went in expecting a psychedelic vision quest, and I came out having experienced a stunning new creation myth. Intricate, upsetting, and fun." - Jeremy Tinder, <em>Boing Boing</em><br><br>&#x201c;I love how the book revels in its midnight horror-style antics: it&#x2019;s funny, weird, gross, and surreal. But what I love most about <em>Safari Honeymoon</em> is the strange yet logical world that Jacobs creates: rife with both decay and renewal, the wilderness is sort of an inverse Eden that shocks and surprises on every page.&#x201d; &#x2015; Gabe Habash, <em>Publishers Weekly</em><br><br></p><h2>Love Letters from God</h2><p>God Cares About You So Much!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wants the best for you.

Instead, the common thread is Griffin himself. Although he frequently finds missing persons, Griffin also struggles to find himself. Narrator G. Valmont Thomas expertly captures Griffin&#39;s hard-boiled intensity. In addition, he draws the listener into the sultry and somber atmosphere of the French Quarter of New Orleans. The combination of Thomas&#39;s voice and Sallis&#39;s words brings the listener into a dark world.

All three are project directors of Behind the Veil."Old people knew things that we'll probably never know," confides one interview subject in this viscerally powerful book and compact disc compilation of firsthand accounts of the Jim Crow era. Drawing on the 1,200 interviews with African-Americans that make up the Duke University collection called Behind the Veil: Documenting African American Life in the Jim Crow South, this sequel to the book-and-audio compilation Remembering Slavery offers testimonies by people from 25 communities in 10 states, representing diverse economic, social and cultural lifestyles urban and rural, industrial and agricultural, Piedmont and Delta. Readers and listeners will confront "the dailiness of the terror blacks experienced at the hands of capricious whites" and of "the capacity of the black community to come to each other's aid and invent means of sustaining the collective will to survive." The editors provide lucid historical context for recollections of family, work, school and church. "[S]tories of rapes and beatings, of houses burned to the ground and land stolen, of harrowing escapes in the middle of the night" appear alongside accounts of "the extraordinary and multiple ways in which resistance to Jim Crow occurred and was nourished." Some of the stories are so extreme as to seem absurd white singers mistakenly sent to a black club conceal themselves under pancake makeup; a county's average expenditure for white students is $40.68 per student, and for black students, $5.95. This moving, deeply instructive book reveals how "African Americans developed their own life, hidden and estranged from the lives of white people." Two one-hour compact discs, 50 b&amp;w photos.

Original.</p><p><p><b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> Evening painted the sky orange, and a chill wind off the bay made Christopher Pike shiver as he walked along San Francisco's waterfront. Red and yellow leaves swirled in the air and danced around the other pedestrians on the street. Coming toward him, a young couple struggled to keep control of both their hovercart full of baggage and their exuberant four- or five-year-old son, who called out happily as he passed, "Were going to Affa Centauri!" "That's nice," said Pike, who had often traveled to Alpha Centauri and beyond. During his ten years as captain of the <i>Enterprise</i> he had gone many places indeed, most of them far more distant -- and far more exotic -- than Sol's nearest neighbor. History moves in cycles, he thought as the family swept past. The street on which he walked had once been named the Embarcadero because it ran along the wharves, and it was from the wharves that people embarked on sailing ships in their travels around the world. When the age of ships had given way to the age of the airplane, the street had become a commercial center, full of warehouses at one end and tourist shops at the other, but nobody had set out on long journeys from there. Then had come space travel and the need for a good place to launch and land passenger ships. The airport was already too busy, and acreage elsewhere was at a premium for living space, so the fledgling industry had turned to the last open space near the sprawling city: the Bay. Now, four centuries after the Embarcadero's genesis, the same street was once again busy with travelers. They were boarding shuttles to take them into orbit rather than wooden ships that plied the ocean, but the spectacle of families struggling with overpacked bags looked the same no matter where they were headed. Pike wished them all well, but he was glad to be on solid ground again. He'd done his time in space, and now he was putting that experience to use as fleet captain, assigned to Starfleet Headquarters right here on good old Mother Earth. He had the best of both worlds: an adventurous past and a position of responsibility on his own home planet. So why did he feel so unfulfilled? He'd been telling himself for the last year or so that he was just growing restless. It had been five years since he'd brought the <i>Enterprise</i> back home for refitting and renovation. He'd originally thought he would resume the conn when the ship was ready to fly again, but it had taken two years to replace all the worn and outdated machinery on board and to increase the crew compliment from 203 to 430, and by then Starfleet had already promoted him out of the job and given it to James Kirk. Pike didn't begrudge him the post; Kirk was a good officer, if a bit impulsive. He would do well if he didn't get himself killed in some defiant act of bravado. And Pike had come to enjoy his new position, but he had to admit he sometimes missed the thrill of facing the unknown. Not very often, though. That thrill usually came hand in hand with mortal danger, and even when Pike survived it, other members of his crew often didn't. He had lost more friends than he cared to count during his decade on the <i>Enterprise,</i> and he had no desire to experience that again. Maybe some captains could go on after a crew fatality without blaming themselves, but he had never been able to. Every time it happened he went through days of anguish and self-recrimination. And every time he took the ship into danger again he worried that his actions would lead to more deaths. No, he didn't envy Kirk the job. Another gust of wind bit through his light topcoat. He had underdressed for the weather. Mark Twain had often said that the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco -- well, he should have tried it in autumn. The western horizon was clear enough to allow a sunset, but the sky directly overhead threatened rain and the air was humid enough that it felt like mist already. Pike looked at the buildings along the waterfront, seeking a store he could duck into to warm up for a moment, and his eyes came upon a sign he hadn't seen before. It was an old-style wooden sign, with letters carved deep into planks held together with black iron bands. It projected out over a windowless doorway and swung gently in the wind, its iron chain squeaking softly. The orange light of sunset made the words THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE stand out in bold relief on its rough surface. Something about the place seemed inviting, yet Pike hesitated before the door. He couldn't very well just duck into a bar for a minute. He would have to order something, and it was a bit early in the evening to start drinking. That wasn't what he had come down here for anyway. He had merely wanted to get some exercise and some fresh air. On the other hand, he didn't have any place special he had to be. The first few drops of rain on his face decided him. He was willing to put up with cold, but cold and wet wasn't part of the plan. He reached for the wrought-iron handle on the solid door and tugged it open, noting a faint tingling sensation as he touched it. A security field of some sort? Or...a transporter? He turned and looked behind him. The Embarcadero was still there. Not a transport beam, then. It sure had felt like it, though. "Close the door!" someone shouted from inside. Pike nearly let it swing back into place without entering, but the rain was picking up so he ducked in and pulled the massive wooden slab closed behind him. He couldn't tell who had spoken. Everyone in the bar was looking at him. There were a dozen or so people, mostly human, seated in twos and threes at tables between him and the bar itself, where a Klingon woman held down a stool and a tall, heavyset man stood on the other side, polishing a beer glass. The glasses were either very small, Pike thought, or the bartender had huge hands to go with the rest of his bulky frame. Fortunately he also wore a smile to match. "Don't pay no mind to Jolley, there," he said. "That's just his way of saying 'Hello.'" Pike nodded. He wouldn't. All his attention was on the Klingon woman. Not because of the unusual bony ridges on her forehead, nor her exotic face with wide, full lips and an enigmatic grin, nor even the ample cleavage revealed by her traditional open-chested battle garb, though Pike found the latter alluring enough for a second look. What drew his attention was the fact that she was there at all. The Klingon Empire and the Federation had been in conflict for nearly fifty years. All-out war seemed imminent, yet here sat a Klingon in a bar on the waterfront not a kilometer from Starfleet Headquarters. She had to be a member of a peace delegation. She had probably snuck away from their hotel to check out Earth without a chaperone breathing down her neck. Maybe she thought she could seduce someone here in the bar and learn military secrets from them. She had undoubtedly recognized Pike the moment he walked in. A fleet captain would be well known to the enemy. Well, Pike would keep his eye on her, too. One of the other patrons was no doubt a Secret Service agent assigned to tail her, but it wouldn't hurt to back him up. He looked for a good place to sit. There was a piano to his immediate left, and a single small table wedged in next to the piano. A lizardlike alien with slits for eyes and talon-sharp fingers was sitting at the table, sipping at a glass full of something red. Pike didn't look too closely; he just nodded and stepped past, unbuttoning his jacket. Most of the tables were to his left, clustered in a semicircle around a large stone fireplace that popped and flared as if it were burning real wood. The ones nearest the fire were obviously the popular places to sit. Pike didn't see any vacant tables there as he approached the bar. "What'll you have, Captain?" the bartender asked. Pike wasn't wearing a uniform, but he assumed the bartender called everyone "captain," after the name of the place. He looked to the mirrored shelves on the back wall to see what kind of stock they kept here, and was surprised to see several bottles of rare and expensive alien liqueurs in among the more common bourbons and gins. He was tempted to ask for Maraltian Seev-ale just to see if they had it, but he wasn't in the mood for the green stuff tonight. "Saurian brandy," he said instead. He had picked up the taste for that on the <i>Enterprise,</i> and it was still his favorite drink. The bartender poured a snifter full from a curved, amber-colored bottle. Pike took a sip and smiled as the volatile spirits warmed their way down, then turned away to look for a quiet table. He didn't want to sit at the bar; he would either have to sit right next to the Klingon woman or close to a scruffy-looking fisherman who had taken a stool halfway between her and the wall. There was a stairway to the right of the bar and two tables in an alcove between that stair and the front door. Neither table was occupied. Pike went over to the smaller of the two and sat facing the rear of the bar at an angle, neither turning his back on the others nor staring at them. He sipped his brandy and examined the decor while conversations started up again at the other tables. There was plenty to look at. Artifacts from dozens of worlds hung on the walls. Pike saw drinking mugs with handles for nonhuman hands, wooden carvings of unrecognizable creatures, and metallic hardware that might have been anything from engine parts to alien sex toys. A Klingon <i>bat'leth</i> stuck out just overhead, its curved blade buried so deeply into the wood that Pike doubted anyone could remove it without a pry bar. A thick layer of dust on it provided evidence that few people even tried. A Vulcan harp hanging from a peg next to it apparently came down more often; there was no dust on it, and the strings were discolored near the fingerboard from use. That was a good sign. Pike liked music better than fighting, too. The fisherman belched loudly, then said to the bartender, "Another tankard o' grog." He looked over at Pike while the bartender refilled his stoneware mug. Pike looked away -- the guy had a drunk and despondent air about him -- but when the fisherman got his drink he stood up and walked over to Pike's table anyway. "You look like a man who's got a lot on his mind," he said as he pulled out a chair and sat down uninvited. Pike could smell the salt and fish and seaweed on him. "I suppose I might have," Pike admitted, "but I didn't really come here to talk." The fisherman didn't take the hint. He leaned back in his chair -- the wooden frame and leather seat squeaking under his weight even though he was lightly built -- and said, "What then? To drink yourself into oblivion? I've tried that. It doesn't work." Pike laughed softly. "I came in because it was cold outside and starting to rain." "An admirable reason for a drink," said the fisherman. He took a gulp of his grog -- Pike could smell the rum from across the table -- and belched again. How could he make this guy go away? "Get lost" would probably do it, but for all Pike knew this was the bar's owner. Or the Secret Service agent. "I'd really rather not --" he began, but the fisherman waved a hand in dismissal. "Now me, I drink because my wife and son were killed on a prison colony." His statement hung in the air between them like a ghost. The short, brutal intensity of those few words and the deep sadness with which they were spoken left Pike gasping for breath even as he tried to think of a response to them. "I -- I'm sorry to hear that" was all he could manage. "Tortured to death," the man went on. "Right in front of me. A place called Rura Penthe." What had Pike gotten himself into now? He looked up toward the bar, saw the Klingon woman flinch as she heard the name of the place, but he had no idea why. It meant nothing to him. "They damned near killed me, too," his unwelcome companion went on. "Forced me to work in the mines, digging nitrates and phosphates for gunpowder while I held the secret that would make their puny chemicals obsolete overnight! I held it, too. Never told a soul. Saved the world, I did." "I'm sure you must have," Pike said. "But perhaps you shouldn't be talking about it now, if it's such a dangerous secret." The man laughed, a single, quick exhalation. "Ha! What do I care now? It's apparently old news. Nuclear power! Splitting the atom! The most elemental force of the universe -- only two hours ago in this very bar someone told me it was nothing compared to antimatter annihilation. And that's apparently nothing compared to zero-point energy, whatever that is." He looked at Pike with eyes red as cooked shrimp. "I held my tongue for <i>nothing.</i>" Who was this guy? Talking as if the secret of nuclear fission was something new. Pike looked at him more closely. His clothing was rough, coarse cotton and wool dyed in drab brown and blue, and he wore a red bandanna around his neck. He had a high forehead and wide-set eyes, and he sported a two- or three-week beard that hadn't been trimmed since he'd started it, but his features underneath it were fair. And young. His general appearance had made him look older, but his hair was still coal black and his skin smooth. He couldn't be much over thirty-five, if that. "Who are you?" Pike asked him. "A fool, apparently," he replied. "One who's seen and suffered more than should be required of any man." He slurped noisily at his grog, then said softly, "At first I tried to serve humanity, then when I realized what I had discovered I tried to protect it, but now I find that I despise humanity and all it stands for." He looked Pike directly in the eyes and said, "And a man who despises humanity must needs despise himself as well. Many's the day I've wondered if I should put an end to it all." Pike heard the sincerity in the man's voice, and his experience as a ship's captain raised the hackles on the back of his neck. Just his luck. He'd come out this evening to dwell on his own problems, and now it looked like he might have to talk someone out of suicide. "Come now," he said. "Whatever your past, you're safe now. You're a free man, warm and dry with a drink in your hand and a roof over your head. Your future can be whatever you make of it." <i>Especially with a little psychiatric help,</i> he thought, but he left that unsaid. "Oh, aye, I'm aware of that," said his unwelcome visitor. "I'm clever enough to make a go of it if I choose. I <i>have</i> made a go of it, come to that." "Oh?" asked Pike. That sounded promising. The fisherman took the bait. "Well, sir, not to brag, but I masterminded an escape from the prison island. I and twenty men stowed away in empty powder casks and let the stevedores load us on board a warship. It was cramped, but no worse than what we suffered in our barracks at night. And there was no worry of being mistreated in a powder cask!" He grinned, then took a drink. "We waited until the ship was at sea, then rose up in the night and took her. The men pronounced me 'captain,' and we became pirates of a sort, preying on our former captors until they brought in too many ships for us to match. We eventually took damage too heavy to repair ourselves, so we withdrew and set sail here for refitting." The glint faded from his eyes and he shook his head sadly. "It may not be worth the effort. Even if we return to Rura Penthe, no amount of battle has yet managed to vanquish the memory of what I have su...</p></p><h2>Red Eagles: America&#39;s Secret MiGs</h2><p>From the mid-1960s until the end of the Cold War, the United States Air Force acquired and flew Russian-made MiG jets, eventually creating a secret squadron dedicated to exposing American fighter pilots to enemy MiGs.

Wahll<br>In 1755 Maj. Gen. Edward Braddock was put in charge of constructing a road from the Potomac River at Wills Creek (Cumberland, MD), to Fort Duquesne (present-day Pittsburgh) at the forks of the Ohio River. His object was to take the fort and thereby launch the conquest of French-held North America. Although Braddock was killed not far from his goal in the grisly clash known today as Braddock's Defeat, the route that he opened ultimately became a highway for western emigration, and part of it was incorporated in the National Road. The making of the Braddock Road was an engineering marvel that tested the abilities and endurance of its builders. The remarkable detail contained in this compilation is too vast to mention here but includes descriptions of forts, personnel, food, Indians, clothing, lodging and more. Carpenters, artificers, shoemakers, tailors, wagonmasters, farriers, nurses, cooks: nothing less than a traveling city was required in the construction of the Braddock Road. Personal journals and official military reports and correspondence are gold mines for anyone who studies the people, events and daily life of the past. The material collected here is extracted from the records of British army regulars (including Braddock, St. Clair, Gage and others), colonial militia (Cresap, Croghan, Gist, Washington, etc.), camp followers, American colonists (Burd, Hamilton, Franklin, Dinwiddie, Delancy, etc.), French-Canadians (Contrecoeur, Dumas, Lotbinier, etc.) and newspapers. The ultimate battle is described firsthand. Short biographical sketches, a chronology and a list of sources round out this comprehensive study.

Wahll <br>Braddock Road Chronicles <br>Having traveled the road between Philadelphia, PA and later Washington, DC to and from central Ohio, I have been interested in this trans-Appalachian corridor since the 1950s. This, my first book is about this historic route in the context of France and England and the final war for empire called French and Indian War, or Seven Years Wars in Europe (1752-1763). Braddock Road Chronicles 1755 is the narrative of the first action of the French and Indian War when England began the conquest of French held North America. In the 1700s only the most daring or desperate half-breed trappers and traders knew anything about the vast howling wilderness to the west. General Braddock with an army of English Grenadiers most of them from Irish units with wagons, cannon and colonial levies was ordered take Fort Duquesne at the forks of the Ohio River. Landing at the tidewater port of Georgetown, Maryland on the Potomac River, the force began marching across the coastal plain to the piedmont and climbed toward the distant Appalachian Mountains. After crossing the Eastern Continental Divide they entered the Ohio River water shed knowing the worst was behind them. This work is the most detailed and comprehensive account of this epic expedition begining with preparations in Ireland, the ocean crossing and ending with the aftermath of the defeat. I have been privileged to have the suggestions of Jim Sorensen and Heather Bouslog on the route through Maryland and at the site of Dowden's Ordinary. Dowden's Ordinary was the only structure to witness the troops march by and was torn down in the 1920s. Bob Bantz, a retired mechanical engineer from Cumberland, MD.allowed me to include his GPS technology plots that laid down the actual right-of-way in Maryland using his field observations and understanding of the land and the march. Carney Rigg of Fort Necessity National Battlefield enabled me to experience the land and events&nbsp;of this locale&nbsp;in George Washington's early life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing this narrative gave me understanding of the research needed before an author can begin to keyboard a manuscript and the need to have a well thought out idea.

He is a regular columnist for <i>Forbes</i> and <i>The Spectator</i>, and his work has also appeared in <i>The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal</i>, and many others publications. He lives in London.<i>Chapter Six</i><br><b>Supreme Power and Frustration</b><p>As prime minister and minister of defense, Churchill held power "in ever growing measure," as he himself put it, from May 1940 to July 1945. Probably no statesman in British history had held power for so long in so concentrated and extensive a form. So the first question to ask is: Did Churchill personally save Britain? Was his leadership essential to its survival and eventual victory?</p><p>The question is best answered by examining the factors and virtues which operated in his favor&#x2014;some determined by objective events, others by his own genius and exertions. They were tenfold. First, as a civilian leader, Churchill benefited from a change of national opinion toward the relative trustworthiness of politicians and service leaders&#x2014;"frocks and brass hats," to use the phrase of his youth. In the First World War, reverence for brass hats and dislike of frocks made it almost impossible for the government, even under Lloyd George at his apotheosis, to conduct the war efficiently. As Churchill put it: "The foolish doctrine was preached to the public through innumerable agencies that generals and admirals must be right on war matters and civilians of all kinds must be wrong&#x2014;inculcated billionfold by the newspapers under the crudest forms." Lloyd George had the greatest difficulty in sacking any senior figure in uniform and could never take the risk of sacking Haig, the armysupremo on the western front, much as he would have liked to.</p><p>By World War II, the truth about the mistakes of the brass hats in the earlier conflict had sunk so deeply into the national consciousness that the position had been almost reversed. There was no war hero until Montgomery made himself one late in the conflict by his own victories. Churchill by contrast came to power with the reputation of having been right throughout the thirties, and was now proved right by the danger in which Britain found herself. He never had to hesitate, except for genuine reasons, before sacking a general, even a popular one like Archibald Wavell, the British commander in Egypt. He felt his authority and exercised it: he was seen walking up and down the empty cabinet room once, after a major sacking, saying aloud, "I want them all to feel my power." Churchill was overwhelmingly admired, even loved, but also feared.</p><p>Second, the concentration of power in Churchill's person, with the backing of all parties, meant that there were never any practical or constitutional obstacles to the right decisions being taken. He always behaved with absolute propriety. He told the king everything and listened to all he said: within months George VI had swung right round in his favor and wrote, "I could not possibly have a better Prime Minister." He also observed all the cabinet procedural rules. Above all, he treated Parliament, especially the House of Commons, with reverence and made it plain he was merely its servant. These were not mere formulae. Insofar as Churchill had a religion, it was the British constitution, spirit and letter: Parliament was the church in which he worshipped and whose decisions he obeyed. All this balanced and sanctified the huge power he possessed and exercised. Unlike Hitler, he operated from within a structure which represented, and was seen and felt to represent, the nation. He was never a dictator, and the awful example of Hitler was ever present before him to prevent him from ever acting like one. This was particularly important in his relations with his service chiefs, such as General Alanbrooke, Admiral Cunningham, and Air Marshal Portal. He and the cabinet took the decisions about the war. But the way in which they were executed was left to the service chiefs. Churchill might cajole and bully, storm and rant, but in the end he always meticulously stuck to the rule and left the responsible senior chiefs to take the decisions. This was the opposite of Hitler's methods, and one principal reason why he lost the war. In another key respect Churchill did the opposite of Hitler: all his orders, without exception, were in writing and were absolutely clear. When issued verbally they were immediately confirmed in written form. All Hitler's orders were verbal and transmitted by aides: "It is theF�hrer's wish...; " Churchill's system of clear written orders, and his punctiliousness in observing the demarcation lines between civilian and military responsibility, is one reason the service chiefs were so loyal to him and his leadership, and indeed revered him, however much his working methods&#x2014;especially his late hours&#x2014; might try their patience and bodies.</p><p>Third, Churchill was personally fortunate in that he took over at a desperate time. The sheer power of the Nazi war machine, against which he had warned, was now revealed. The worst, as it were, had happened, was happening, or was about to happen. He was able to say in perfect truth, just after he took power (May 13, 1940), "I would say to the House, as I said to those who have joined the government, 'I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat.' " He added, in the same speech, that his aim was quite simple and clear: "Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory there is no survival." The last words were of deadly significance, and felt to be so. For Britain was not facing defeat in the sense that it had been defeated in the American War of Independence. It was facing extinction as a free country. Ordinary people were made to feel that. On Churchill's orders, the national anthems of the Allies were played on the BBC before the 9:00 p.m. news every Sunday. There were seven of them, six already defeated, occupied, and under the total control of the Gestapo. Soon, France joined the losers.Churchill certainly did all in his power to save her, paying five perilous visits to consult with her disintegrating, scared, and defeatist government and service chiefs. He would not, however&#x2014;and rightly&#x2014;go beyond a certain point. He was prepared to offer France a union of the two states, a most imaginative and adventurous idea, characteristic of his fertility. He was not willing, however, to comply with their request to send all of Britain's precious fighter squadrons to France in a despairing effort to stem the Nazi blitzkrieg. That, he said, would be "hurling snowballs into Hell." Instead, as France lurched toward dishonorable surrender and puppet status under Marshal P�tain, Churchill concentrated on getting the British Expeditionary Force safely back home. And he succeeded. Nine-tenths were rescued from Dunkirk, and many Allied soldiers with them, more than three hundred thousand in all, brought back by an improvised armada of ships, great and small, including pleasure cruisers and fishing boats, which gave picturesque color and even romance to the story, a typically British tale of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Thus within a month of taking office, amid the unmitigated catastrophe of France's fall, Churchill was able to report a British victory&#x2014;Dunkirk&#x2014;and to speak glowingly of "the Dunkirk spirit." It was in a sense a bogus victory, for the troops had been forced to leave their heavy equipment behind, and in many cases even their rifles, which they had smashed before embarking. But Dunkirk nevertheless gave a huge boost to British morale: now that Churchill was in charge, the people felt that, far from plunging further down into the abyss, the country was moving upward, if only an inch at a time.</p><p>Fourth, Churchill himself began to set a personal example of furious and productive activity at Ten Downing Street. He was sixty-five but he looked, seemed&#x2014;was, indeed&#x2014;the embodiment of energy. He worked a sixteen-hour day. He sought to make everyone else do likewise. In contrast to lethargic, self-indulgent old Asquith ("the bridge-player at the Wharf," as Churchill called him) or even Lloyd George, who had high tea instead of a proper dinner to discus strategy and went to bed at nine o'clock, Churchill began to wear his own form of labor-saving uniform, a siren suit, easy to put on or take off, in which he could nap if he wanted during long nighttime spells at work. This added hugely to the fast-accumulating Churchill legend: the public called it his "rompers." In fact, thanks to Clemmie, some of these siren suits were of elaborate and costly materials, velvet and silk as well as wool&#x2014;for "best" parties in the Number Ten bombproof dining room, and so on. Churchill had always used clothes for personal propaganda and had a propensity to collect unusual uniforms. Since 1913 he had been an elder brother of Trinity House, a medieval institution which supervised all lighthouses and port lights in the British Isles. Its uniform had a distinctive nautical flavor and for court dress he always wore it in preference to that of his Privy Council. General de Gaulle, who had by now taken charge of France's resistance forces, asked him what it was and received the mystifying reply, "Je suis un fr�re a�n� de la Sainte Trinit�." But the siren suit was the everyday wartime wear and proved a masterstroke of propaganda. In it the prime minister worked within days of taking over, as the first brief and pointed memos and orders flowed out under the famous headline: "Action This Day." So did the endless series of brief, urgent queries: "Pray inform me on one half-sheet of paper, why...; " Answers had to be given, fast. Churchill had teams of what he called "dictation secretaries." He worked them very long hours. He was sometimes brusque or angry, swore, forgot their names, even lost his temper. But he also smiled, joked, dazzled them with uproarious charm and whimsicalities. They all loved him and were proud to work with him. They helped him to turn Number Ten into a dynamo, and its reverberations gradually resounded through the entire old-fashioned, lazy, obstructive, and cumbersome government machine, until it began to hum, too. Churchill's sheer energy and, not least, his ability to switch it off abruptly when not needed were central keys to his life, and especially his wartime leadership. But it must be admitted that he killed men who could not keep up&#x2014;Admiral Pound, for instance, and General Sir John Dill&#x2014;just as Napoleon Bonaparte killed horses under him.</p><p>The fifth factor was Churchill's oratory. It is a curious fact that he switched it on to its full power just as Hitler switched his off. Hitler had been, in his time, the greatest rabble-rouser of the twentieth century. In his successful attempt to destroy Versailles and make Germany a great power again&#x2014;incidentally ending unemployment&#x2014;his oratory had been a vital factor in making him the most popular leader in German history (1933&#x2013;39). But the Germans, while overwhelmingly behind the campaign against Versailles, had no desire to see Hitler turn Europe into a servile German empire, let alone lead them into a world war. When Hitler marched into Prague in March 1939 it was his first unpopular act. Until now he had ruled mainly by consent. Thereafter it was by force and fear. Sensing his loss of personal popularity, Hitler ceased to address the Reichstag or make public speeches. By the time Churchill took charge, Hitler had retreated into his various military headquarters, mostly underground, rarely appearing and never speaking in public. He became a troglodyte, while Churchill became a world figure ubiquitous in newspapers and newsreels wherever Nazi censorship had no control.</p><p>The oratory had two interlocking audiences: the Commons and the radio listener. Here a personal word is in order. I was twelve when Churchill took power and had learned to caricature him since the age of five (I could also do Mussolini, Stalin, and Roosevelt). My father, having served four years in the trenches and lost friends in the Dardanelles, was suspicious of Churchill. In April 1940 I recall his saying, "There's talk of making that fellow Churchill prime minister." But by early May events had swung him round: "It looks as if we'll have to put Winston in charge." By then the nation was calling him "Winston." My father and I read in the newspaper together all his speeches in the late spring and summer of 1940, and listened to all his regular broadcasts. The combined effect was electrifying and transforming. I can remember the tone of voice, the words, many whole phrases to this day. There were two passages in particular. After Dunkirk, and before the last phases in the already lost battle on the Continent, he insisted (June 4):We shall not flag or fail. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.</p><p>In the Commons, Churchill characteristically supplemented the passage with a joking aside, sotto voce, "We shall fight with pitchforks and broomsticks, it's about all we've bloody got." Jokes were never far away when Churchill spoke, even in the gloomiest times. He was rather like Dr. Johnson's old friend from Pembroke College: "I try to be a philosopher, but cheerfulness keeps breaking in." Of course we did not know that bit about the pitchforks. But the bit about never surrendering rang true. We believed it, we meant it.</p></p><h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers: Fandemonium</h2><p><p>One-of-a-kind tribute from one of the best-selling bands in the world direct to their legions of fans. The Red Hot Chili Peppers' performances have become legendary as much for the music and antics on stage as the generous, loving community of people who stand side by side, screaming their approval. This is a fan appreciation book from the band that puts the emphasis where it should be&#x2014;on the fans. A vivid montage of words from the band members to their fans, it includes hundreds of photos taken at concerts worldwide, and interviews with fifty of the most devoted RHCP fans around the globe.

Join him as he unveils the awesome greatness of God&#x2013;His incredible holiness, deep wisdom, and especially His inspiring love.

This work, The Joy of Fearing God, is no different. The fear of God he writes of in his classic work is one of intense, joyous, intimate relationship with a sovereign God who, though He demands perfect obedience, has nevertheless opened wide his arms of welcome to sinners. It is because we are conscious of both our own sinfulness and His indescribable condescension and love that we run into His presence with worship and awe.

Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour. Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, fighting for their lives against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. When the unit was rescued the following morning, 18 American soldiers were dead and more than 70 badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse - more than 500 killed and over 1000 injured. Authoritative, and insightful, &#34;Black Hawk Down&#34; is a minute-by-minute account of modern war. This story is now a major motion picture directed by Ridley Scott, and starring an ensemble cast including Josh Hartnett, Ewen McGregor, Jason Isaacs, Tom Sizemore, Orlando Bloom, Eric Bana, Ron Eldard, Jeremy Piven and Sam Shepherd.</p><p>Journalist Mark Bowden delivers a strikingly detailed account of the 1993 nightmare operation in Mogadishu that left 18 American soldiers dead and many more wounded. This early foreign-policy disaster for the Clinton administration led to the resignation of Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and a total troop withdrawal from Somalia. Bowden does not spend much time considering the context; instead he provides a moment-by-moment chronicle of what happened in the air and on the ground. His gritty narrative tells of how Rangers and elite Delta Force troops embarked on a mission to capture a pair of high-ranking deputies to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid only to find themselves surrounded in a hostile African city. Their high-tech MH-60 Black Hawk helicopters had been shot down and a number of other miscues left them trapped through the night. Bowden describes Mogadishu as a place of Mad Max-like anarchy--implying strongly that there was never any peace for the supposed peacekeepers to keep. He makes full use of the defense bureaucracy's extensive paper trail--which includes official reports, investigations, and even radio transcripts--to describe the combat with great accuracy, right down to the actual dialogue. He supplements this with hundreds of his own interviews, turning <i>Black Hawk Down</i> into a completely authentic nonfiction novel, a lively page-turner that will make readers feel like they're standing beside the embattled troops. This will quickly be realized as a modern military classic. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Ninety-nine elite American soldiers are trapped in the middle of a hostile city. As night falls, they are surrounded by thousands of enemy gunmen. Their wounded are bleeding to death. Their ammunition and supplies are dwindling. This is the story of how they got there-and how they fought their way out. This is the story of war. Black Hawk Down drops you into a crowded marketplace in the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia with the U.S. Special Forces-and puts you in the middle of the most intense firefight American soldiers have fought since the Vietnam War. Late in the afternoon of Sunday, October 3, 1993, the soldiers of Task Force Ranger were sent on a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour. Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, locked in a desperate struggle to kill or be killed. When the unit was finally rescued the following morning, eighteen American soldiers were dead and dozens more badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse: more than five hundred killed and over a thousand wounded. <p>Award-winning literary journalist Mark Bowden's dramatic narrative captures this harrowing ordeal through the eyes of the young men who fought that day. He draws on his extensive interviews of participants from both sides-as well as classified combat video and radio transcripts-to bring their stories to life. A Black Hawk pilot is shot down and besieged by an angry mob, then saved by Somalis who plan to ransom him to the local warlord. A medic desperately tries to keep his grievously wounded friend alive long enough to be evacuated-only to have him bleed to death in his arms. The company clerk, who is the butt of jokes in the barracks, rises to the task and per-forms extraordinary feats of valor. </p><p>Authoritative, gripping, and insightful, Black Hawk Down is a riveting look at the terror and exhilaration of combat, destined to become a classic of war reporting. </p><p>"Terrifyingly real . . .

The concepts found in Jewish mysticism can often be difficult even for the learned person to grasp because its principles are embedded in parables, analogies, and examples. Whether one has had a rich Jewish education or has just been introduced to the world of Jewish thought, the lofty concepts of Kabbalah can be difficult to relate to in a down-to-earth way. Just as one must master his or her profession in order to succeed, one must learn Chasidism so as to internalize its teachings, says author Rabbi Chaim Dalfin. Only then do the esoteric principles of mysticism appear in their practical application to today&#39;s world. This applied study of mysticism is actually in accordance with the basic thrust of Chasidism as it originated. Both the Baal Shem Tov, the founder and inspiration of the chasidic movement, and the Alter Rebbe, the founder of Chabad Chasidism, began with highly abstract thoughts but transmitted them into accessible terms. This system is considered unique because Kabbalah is an esoteric tradition that deals with concepts of worlds, processes, and levels of being that are not visible or tangible, while classical Jewish thought, such as the Talmud and the Jewish legal tradition, deals almost entirely with tangible things such as property, marriage, and holidays. For the beginner, the author has provided the basic terms that are used throughout the book at the beginning of each chapter. He has also included a list of questions for each chapter in the appendix.</p><h2>The Shape of Knitting: A Master Class in Increases, Decreases, and Other Forms of Shaping</h2><p>In <i>The Shape of Knitting</i>, innovative designer Lynne Barr gives readers a fascinating, in-depth master class on the techniques that can be used to shape flat and dimensional pieces of knitting&#x2015;increases, decreases, short rows, dividing and combining stitches, and adding sections.

The essence of counterpoint, however, is something deeper than a process of manipulation. It is an ingredient of the inner vitality of music and is found in nearly all music. It is to an understanding of counterpoint as such that this book is directed.</strong></p> In <em>Counterpoint</em>&#x2015;for many years one of the most highly regarded texts in the field&#x2015;the principles by which the contrapuntal element has operated in the works of composers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centures are presented. The counterpoint studied is the harmonic, rhythmic, instrumental style so well represented by the music of Bach. For it is this style that most of the composers who came after Bach, including those of our own time, have regarded as the ideal of contrapuntal technique. Piston's method in <em>Counterpoint</em> is to discover how music has been written rather than how it should be written. This book, in contrast to most traditional studies, states principles and gives rules that are based on actual observations of the practice of composers rather than those invented by the theorist. It offers examples drawn from the works of standard composers rather than those constructed by the author. The literature of the last three hundred years is examined to form the logical basis for this study. Throughout the book, exercises are provided that call for the writing of music and that are intended to clarify the principles under discussion.<br><br> Walter Piston, one of America's outstanding composers, created for this book an approach to the study of counterpoint that is stimulating and helpful to an understanding of the music of all times.</p><p>Walter Piston was Professor of Music at Harvard University.

But, as with all quests, the Fates intervene. A car wreck introduces him to various helpers and hindrances, and gradually Ben undertakes a journey back through his own past. As he nears the apple-growing country in which he grew up, he recalls the signal events of his youth and manhood-especially his wartime experiences and his profound love for his wife of fifty years. Ben is transformed into an American Odysseus as he confronts the many sides of his own nature in a novel that radiates with the glories of the natural world and the mysterious permutations of the human heart.</p><p>David Guterson's first novel, <i>Snow Falling on Cedars</i>, was a true ensemble piece, in which even a high-stakes murder trial seemed like a judgment passed on the community at large. In his eloquent second novel, however, the author swings dramatically in the opposite direction. <i>East of the Mountains</i> is the tale of a solitary, 73-year-old Seattle widower. A retired heart surgeon, Ben Givens is an old hand at turning isolation to his advantage, both professionally and personally: "When everything human was erased from existence except that narrow antiseptic window through which another's heart could be manipulated--few were as adroit as Dr. Givens."<p> Now, however, Ben has been dealt a problem entirely beyond his powers of manipulation: a diagnosis of terminal cancer. With just a few months to live, he sets out across the Cascades for a hunting trip, planning to take his own life once he reaches the high desert. A car crash en route puts an initial crimp in this suicide mission. But the ailing surgeon presses onward--and begins a simultaneous journey into the past. Between present-tense episodes, which demonstrate Ben's cranky commitment to his own extinction, we learn about his boyhood in Washington's apple country, his traumatic war experience in the Italian Alps, and the beginning of his vocation.</p><p> Guterson narrates the apple-scented idyll of Ben's childhood in a typically low-key manner--and orchards, of course, are seldom the stuff of melodrama. Still, many of his ambling sentences offer miniature lessons in patience and perception: "They rode back all day to the Columbia, traversed it on the Colockum Ferry, and at dusk came into their orchard tired, on empty stomachs, their hats tipped back, to walk the horses between the rows of trees in a silent kind of processional, and Aidan ran his hands over limbs as he passed them with his horse behind him, the limbs trembling in the wake of his passing, and on, then, to the barn." The wartime episodes, however, are less satisfactory. Clearly Guterson has done his research down to the last stray bullet, but there's a second-hand feeling to the material, which seems less a token of Ben's detachment than the author's.</p><p> There is, alas, an additional problem. Begin a story with a planned suicide, and there are exactly two possible outcomes. It would be unfair to reveal Ben's fate. But as the forces of life and death yank him one way, then another, Guterson tends to stack the deck--particularly during a bus ride toward the end of the novel, when Ben's fellow passengers appear to have wandered in from a Frank Capra film. Yet <i>East of the Mountains</i> remains a beautifully imagined work, in which the landscape reflects both Ben's desperation and his intermittent delight. And Guterson knows from the start what his protagonist learns in painful increments: that "a neat, uncomplicated end" doesn't exist on either side of the mountains. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>&#x201c;A compassionate and masterful achievement.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle <br><br></i>&#x201d;A strikingly joyful book and a monumental achievement.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br></i> &#x201c;The writing is wonderful throughout, the characters are vivid...heartfelt, engaging and well drawn.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Miami Herald<br></i><br> &#x201c;Profound and ambitious. . . .

In recent years there has been a reclaiming of the riches of contemplative prayer forms of Western traditions. Through the practice of lectio divina you become present to each moment in a heart-centred way. Gradually, the practice of lectio expands your capacity to sense God&#39;s presence until all of life becomes a cascade of prayer. Drawing on her own experience as a monk in the world, Christine Valters Paintner breaks open the movements of this spiritual practice. She makes them accessible to the contemporary reader who longs for a more pervasive experience of the holy in the everyday but lives far away from the sanctuary of a monastery.</p><p>Christine Valters Painter, PhD, is a writer, teacher and the online abbess of www.abbeyofthearts.com, a virtual monastery dedicated to nurturing contemplative practice and creative expression. She frequently leads retreats and teaches on the wisdom of Benedictine, Celtic and desert ways of praying.</p><h2>Advanced Machine Work</h2><p>Here&#39;s the best general machine shop book I&#39;ve ever seen old or new.

Young girls in trances pointed out neighbors, leaders, relatives--over 150 people were arrested, with many hanged for their supposed sins. Frances Hill, author of A Delusion of Satan, brings her deep historical and political understanding together with her honed skills as a novelist to produce a picture of the trials both realistic and emotional. She has written an extraordinary and gripping novel of hysteria, power plays, and love in colonial America.</p><p>Frances Hill is a historian, novelist, and journalist whose previous books include A Delusion of Satan: The Full Story of the Salem Witch Trials Reader, Hunting for Witches: A Visitor&#39;s Guide to the Salem Witch Trials, and Such Men Are Dangerous: The Fanatics of 1692 and 2004.Hill (Out of Bounds) has written extensively as a historian on the Salem witch trials, and taps expertly into this knowledge for her third novel&nbsp;aiming "to reach the essential truths." Almost her entire cast of characters consists of the actual people who lived, worshipped, and suffered in 17th-century Salem during the witch hunts. In January 1692, the unordained Rev. George Burroughs and his closest friend, Capt. Peter White, are living in the remote settlement of Wells, in Maine, where Burroughs rescues young Mary Cheever after a local Indian massacre. Meanwhile, in Salem, Mass., Burroughs's former parish, two girls on a winter's night whip themselves into a frenzy that sends the whole of Salem into superstition and hysteria resulting in the witch examinations and trials. Burroughs, now married to Mary, is accused as the "leader of witches," arrested, and taken in irons to Salem. Mary and Peter travel to Salem, where their energetic efforts to prove his innocence fail, including Mary's&nbsp;meeting with the priggish, lecherous religious figure Cotton Mather. Hill's done a fine job with a subject that's inspired countless accounts, adding historical content that makes this treatment stand out from the rest. (Mar.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

The world according to her is black and white; anything in between is confusing. Before, when things got confusing, Caitlin went to her older brother, Devon, for help. But Devon has died, and Caitlin&#39;s dad is so distraught that he is just not helpful. Caitlin wants everything to go back to the way things were, but she doesn&#39;t know how to do that. Then she comes across the word closure- and she realizes this is what she needs. And in her search for it, Caitlin discovers that the world may not be black and white after all.</p><p><b>Kathryn Erskine</b> spent many years as a lawyer before realizing that she'd rather write things that people might actually enjoy reading. She grew up mostly overseas and attended eight different schools, her favorite being the Hogwarts-type castle in Scotland. The faculty, of course, did not consist of wizards, although ... how did the headmistress know that it was "the wee redhead" who led the campaign to free the mice from the biology lab? Erskine draws on her childhood--and her second childhood through her children--for her stories. She still loves to travel but nowadays most trips tend to be local, such as basketball and tennis courts, occasional emergency room visits, and the natural food store for very healthy organic chocolate with "life saving" flavonoids.Grade 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;From inside Caitlin's head, readers see the very personal aftermath of a middle school shooting that took the life of the older brother she adored. Caitlin is a bright fifth grader and a gifted artist. She also has Asperger's syndrome, and her brother, Devon, was the one who helped her interpret the world. Now she has only her father, a widower who is grieving anew and whose ability to relate to his daughter is limited. A compassionate school counselor works with her, trying to teach her the social skills that are so difficult for her. Through her own efforts and her therapy sessions, she begins to come to terms with her loss and makes her first, tentative steps toward friendship. Caitlin's thought processes, including her own brand of logic, are made remarkably clear. The longer readers spend in the child's world, the more understandable her entirely literal and dispassionate interpretations are. Marred slightly by the portrayal of Devon as a perfect being, this is nonetheless a valuable book. After getting to know Caitlin, young people's tendencies to label those around them as either "normal" or "weird" will seem as simplistic and inadequate a system as it truly is.&#x2014;<i>Faith Brautigam, Gail Borden Public Library, Elgin, IL</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

This beautiful book, written by a group of scholars in the field of Russian decorative arts and cultural history, illuminates the lost world of Faberge&#39;s collectors, and presents a selection of superb examples of these objects of fantasy. Richly illustrated with photographs of Faberge work now in museums and private collections, including that of Queen Elizabeth II of England, the book will enthrall lovers of the decorative arts and will fascinate anyone interested in European cultural history.</p><p>Marilyn Pfeifer Swezey is an independent scholar of Russian decorative arts and cultural history. Alexander von Solodkoff is a historian of Russian decorative arts. Joyce Lasky Reed is the president of the Faberg� Arts Foundation of Washington, D.C., and St. Petersburg, Russia.At one time, the royal families in Europe and Russia were accustomed to having their every whim satisfied, even apparently impossible desires like freezing and preserving nature in its most perfect form. This collection of photographs and essays documents Carl Faberg�&#x2019;s attempts to do just that for the Russian Imperial Family and other aristocrats throughout Europe. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Faberg� (who&#x2019;s best known for his extravagant jeweled Easter eggs) created delicate replicas of pansies, lilies of the valley, violets and other flowers and berries that were most often destined for glass display cabinets in the royal palaces of London and Moscow. In somewhat dry terms that draw heavily on sales ledgers and collection inventories, Swezey, a noted authority on the Russian Imperial Family, and a handful of decorative arts experts chronicle the history of the sculptures, from their genesis to the disappearance of many during the outbreak of the Soviet revolution. The lush color photos allow readers to get closer to the pieces than they could ever hope to otherwise, so close that one can see the real fuzz used to augment an intricately crafted dandelion puff and get a sense of how the jars were fashioned in order to look like they were filled with water. Sadly, the book is short on insights into how these impressive pieces of art were made. Instead, the text concentrates on Faberg�&#x2019;s relationship with his royal patrons. Although the text is no match for the crisp, bright illustrations and likely won&#x2019;t interest many outside a small group of curators and collectors, the images are an eye-pleasing introduction to Faberg�&#x2019;s talent for reproducing, and sometimes improving upon, natural beauty. 78 illustrations, including 70 full-color plates.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Thant Myint-U is in a unique position to know. Over the past few years he has traveled extensively across this vast territory, where high-speed trains and gleaming new shopping malls are now coming within striking distance of the last far-flung rebellions and impoverished mountain communities. And he has explored the new strategic centrality of Burma, where Asia's two rising, giant powers appear to be vying for supremacy. </p><p>At once a travelogue, a work of history, and an informed look into the future, <i>Where China Meets India </i>takes us across the fast-changing Asian frontier, giving us a masterful account of the region's long and rich history and its sudden significance for the rest of the world.</p></p><p><p>Thant Myint-U was educated at Harvard and Cambridge Universities and later taught history for several years as a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.

He is the author of a personal history of Burma, <i>The River of Lost Footsteps.</i></p>WHERE CHINA MEETS INDIA (Irrawaddy Dreaming)<p>Before there was Rangoon, there was the Shwedagon pagoda. The legend goes something like this. Twenty-five centuries ago, two merchant brothers named Tapussa and Bhallika met the Buddha, by chance, just days after his Enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, in northern India. They heard his teachings on how to respond to the generally unsatisfactory nature of human experience. They became amongst his first followers, presenting him with an offering of rice cakes and honey and asking for a token of their encounter. The Buddha gave them eight strands of hair from his head. The Burmese believe that Tapussa and Bhallika were from lower Burma and that on their return home they placed the hairs in a jewelled casket and enshrined the casket deep within what would become the Shwedagon pagoda.</p><p>The pagoda sits today in the middle of Rangoon, a sprawling city of five million people, on the only hill for miles around. It is an enormous golden structure nearly 400 feet high, shaped something like an upside-down funnel, with an octagonal base, a rounded dome, and then a long spire. The lower sections are covered in gold leaf, the upper sections in plates of solid gold. Altogether the Shwedagon is said to be enveloped in no less than sixty tons of gold. 'More than in all the vaults of the Bank of England', the Burmese used to say during the days of British rule. At the top the spire is encrusted with thousands of precious stones as well as diamonds totalling 2,000 carats. Archaeologists and historians are uncertain about the true age of the Shwedagon. It is known that the pagoda (in its current form) was built in the fifteenth century, but that it was built on top of far older structures, likely dating back at least to the early centuries AD. A treasure chamber doubtless exists within its innermost recesses.</p><p>The Shwedagon can be seen from almost anywhere in the city, reflecting the sun by day and floodlit at night. There is perhaps no other city in the world as dominated, physically and spiritually, by a religious site as Rangoon is by the Shwedagon. Rudyard Kipling, after a visit in 1889, described it as 'a golden mystery' and 'a beautiful winking wonder that blazed in the sun'. Thirty-three years later, Somerset Maugham, who had stopped briefly in Rangoon, remembered that the Shwedagon 'rose superb, glistening with its gold like a sudden hope in the dark night of the soul'.</p><p>It was dusk when I arrived at the Shwedagon. Statues of two giant griffins or chinth�s, the winged half-man half-lion creatures of Burmese mythology, guarded the base of the immense staircase that led up to the main platform. The stairs were made of teak, dark and smooth, and as wide as a street, lined on each side with little stalls, each selling flowers or incense or religious icons. The sellers, like most stallholders in Burma, were women, some with their children playing nearby.</p><p>A high roof covered the stairs and so it was only at the very top that the Shwedagon suddenly came into view, surrounded by a complex of dozens of smaller pagodas, pavilions, rest-houses, and shrines of different shapes and sizes, all laid out in no particular manner, the result of centuries of gradual augmentation. Many of the pavilions housed statues of the Buddha, big ones and small ones, the pillars of these pavilions covered in gold leaf or in glass mosaics. It was like a little city from a fairy tale.</p><p>Buddhism is the religion of an estimated 85 per cent of all people in Burma (the rest are mainly Christians and Muslims) and all Burmese Buddhists are meant to try to visit the Shwedagon at least once in their lifetime. I can't guess the number of people who were there that evening, certainly in the hundreds, probably in the thousands. Nearly all were wearing a sarong-like longyi, patterned and tied differently for men and women, together with a shirt or blouse. Most were probably from Rangoon, people coming after work, but at least some were villagers from far away, their longyis in less fashionable patterns and a little more threadbare. There were Buddhist monks as well, in rust-coloured robes, and nuns in pale pink. Everyone was in their bare feet, as is traditional and required at all sacred sites. The air was scented with jasmine and marigold, and at some shrines people were lighting little rows of flickering candles. I went into one of the larger pavilions where there were already a few other people, including an old lady, her eyes tightly closed and her long grey hair tied up in a bun, kneeling on the floor, their hands clasped together in prayer, facing the large statue of the Buddha in front of them. I first knelt as well and then touched my head and hands to the ground.</p><p>For some, Buddhism is primarily a philosophy, a guide to being happy and knowing how best to deal with the vicissitudes of life. A visit to the Shwedagon is an opportunity to be reminded of the Buddha's teachings, perhaps meditate quietly, or simply try to calm your mind after a hectic and stressful day.</p><p>For most Burmese, however, the Shwedagon is also a magical place. The faithful believe that somewhere beneath the gilded stupa are not only the hair relics of the historical Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, but the relics of past Buddhas as well, from aeons ago: the staff of Kakusandha, the water filter of Konagamana, and a piece of the robe of Kassapa, and that all these relics impart the Shwedagon with supernatural power.</p><p>The Shwedagon is also the haunt of weizzas or wizards, Tantric adepts who have achieved special abilities (like everlasting youth or invisibility). There is a small pagoda, towards the southwest, decorated with the figures of wizards and necromancers from times past, where some believe invisible beings come to meditate. There is also a pavilion dedicated to Izza Gawna, a wizard and alchemist of medieval times, and a 'Shrine of the Sun and Moon', whose two Buddha statues are said to grant the wishes of all who come to pay their respects.</p><p>The pagoda has also played its role in Burmese history. To the north is the 'Victory Ground', an open area where people come to pray for success of any kind, religious or secular. Traditionally, kings and generals came here before leaving for war. More recently, it has been the place to begin political protests. One of the first was in 1920, when students camped here at the start of an anti-colonial campaign. There's a column nearby in their memory, with their names written not only in Burmese and English but also in Russian, a sign of the high hopes the anti-colonialists then had for the recent Bolshevik Revolution. And protesters have gathered here ever since. In September 2007, thousands of Buddhist monks led peaceful marches against the ruling military junta. The demonstrations lasted for several days and on each day the monks started here at the 'Victory Ground'. But at least in this case their wishes went unfulfilled as riot police eventually closed in, sealing off the Shwedagon complex, and violently ending the demonstrations.</p><p>There may be wizards and the occasional protestors, but there are still very few foreign tourists. I saw one that evening, looking relaxed, in khakis and T-shirt, sitting cross-legged with his camera on the marble floor, watching the Burmese go by. I may be biased, but I would rank the Shwedagon as easily an equal of any of the other great sites I have seen, including the pyramids in Mexico, Angkor Wat in Cambodia, or the Taj Mahal. Ralph Fitch was the first Englishman ever to come to Burma, in 1584 as the captain of 'the talle shippe Tyger' (the ship mentioned, some say, by Shakespeare in Macbeth), and he said of the Shwedagon: 'It is, as I suppose, the fairest place that doe bee in all the Worlde.' From the beginning of 1962 through the 1980s, it was difficult to travel to Burma and tourism was discouraged. That has changed and it is today easy to visit. But in the place of old government restrictions there are now boycott campaigns from overseas, campaigns that have called on would-be tourists to stay away from Burma, so as not to contribute to the coffers of the ruling generals. The boycotts have been terrible for the country's nascent tourism industry, but have had the benefit of keeping back the hordes that will almost certainly one day come.</p><p>It was dark by the time I climbed back down the stairs and walked to the busy roundabout in front, to hail a taxi and drive to the 365 Caf�.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Edward was a Burmese businessman in his late fifties, a strongly built man with thinning salt and pepper hair, who had worked for several years in Singapore, as an engineer, before returning to Rangoon, his home town. He had a Burmese name as well, but like many of his class and generation had received an English name at school. The Burmese name he used for any official purpose and was the way he introduced himself to any new acquaintances. But to old friends (he was an old friend of my family's), he had remained 'Edward'.</p><p>He was waiting for me when I arrived, dressed in a dark Hawaiian shirt and a Burmese longyi. He had a broad, almost Polynesian, face, and looked tanned and healthy. We spoke in a mix of Burmese and English. 'Business is bad,' he said. 'Sometimes I think I made a big mistake coming back. I should have stayed in Singapore or gone to America when I had the opportunity. My brother's there, you know, in San Diego. He offered to find me a job, ages ago. My mistake.'</p><p>Edward had suggested the 365 Caf�. It was downtown, on the ground floor of the Thamada or 'President' hotel. It was decorated in a bright international style, with comfortable faux-leather chairs, and had a menu that offered a mix of sandwiches and Asian dishes. Big glass windows covered an entire wall, and through them you could see a small car park, with a couple of old Japanese cars and a big truck filled with crates of orangeade bottles. Beyond the parking lot was the street, and then a tall hedge, and finally a red-brick church, looking exactly like a church in a small English town.</p><p>'We have nothing like a proper business environment,' h...</p></p><h2>The Vitality Imperative: How connected leaders and their teams achieve more with less time, money, and stress</h2><p>The ever-present challenge for leaders is how to get more done with less time, money, and stress.<br> <br> <i>The Vitality Imperative</i> answers that challenge and gives leaders a reliable and actionable road map for creating and sustaining a humane and lasting approach to the thorniest challenges and opportunities modern organizations face.<br> <br> <i>The Vitality Imperative </i> will teach:<br> 7 key promises that connected leaders make to ignite and sustain vitality<br> Self-evident principles to provoke new thought and action<br> Engaging examples of these principles in action<br> Personal and team practices to test the principles and cultivate personal and organizational effectiveness.<br> <br>Based on over 25 years of research and application in Fortune 500 organizations on six continents around the?world, this book describes how connected leadershipTM builds a working culture of energized high performance, characterized by community, contribution, and choice.<br> <br> <i>The Vitality Imperative</i> is about return-on-effort.

Now facing mandatory retirement from the factory where hes worked all of his adult life, he contemplates going home to Morocco for good. His dream is to build a house large enough for his six children and their families to join him. Though he loathes the forced retirement, Mohammed is gripped by this dream and starts construction on his dream house, even though his rebellious, thoroughly Westernized children show no interest in joining him at his house or forming much of a relationship with their old-fashioned father. Esteemed Moroccan author Ben Jalloun explores Mohammeds complicated feelings of ennui and alienation from the country that has been his home for decades and from his own children, whom he neither knows nor understands. The story builds to an end that seems as inevitable as it is symbolic of Mohammeds isolation within his own family.

It is an affectionate, unforgettable portrait of a time, a people, and a place, as well as the indomitable spirit of this island province.</p><p>Farley Mowat became a writer in 1949 after spending two years in the<br>Arctic. He is the bestselling author of thirty-nine books, including<br><i>Never Cry Wolf, Owls in the Family, The Dog Who Wouldn't Be,</i> and<br><i>The Boat Who Wouldn't Float.</i> He and his wife, Claire, divide their<br>time between Port Hope and River Bourgeois, Nova Scotia.Such was the nature of the creature that lay awaiting me at dockside when I disembarked at Port aux Basques. Already laden to her marks, the SS <i>Baccalieu</i> was noisily blowing off surplus steam, which veiled her black hull and white-�painted upperworks.<br><br>She was not going to be crowded on this trip. Instead of her usual complement of a hundred or so passengers, she was carrying only seventy-�five. Her blushing young purser, who was new to his job, gave me cabin B on the upper deck. It was a wonder of Victorian elegance gone a little shoddy: creaky wicker chairs, worn Persian carpet, etched glass in the alleyway door, and an enormous English &#x201c;water closet&#x201d; almost big enough to serve as a sitz bath.<br><br>I had barely taken all this in when the ship&#x2019;s whistle let out a throaty roar and <i>Baccalieu</i> began to throb with the slow revolution of her great propeller shaft. I rushed on deck to find we were underway; but there was little to see. Night had fallen and the weather was chill and &#x201c;thick-�a-�fog,&#x201d; as a passing deckhand unnecessarily noted. Never mind. I retreated to the snug warmth of my cabin for a good night&#x2019;s sleep.<br><br>It was not to be. At 11:30 p.m. a deckhand knocked hard upon my door to tell me the captain wanted me on the bridge.<br><br>Half expecting we would be taking to the lifeboats, I flung on my clothing, hurried across the bridge deck, and entered the wheelhouse &#x2014; the holy of holies on any ship. A squat figure took shape in the darkness within and introduced himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Ernie Riggs, skipper of this one. Heard you&#x2019;ve been in the salvage boats out of Halifax. Thought you might like to help us take this old she-�cunt into Rose Blanche . . . if we can <i>get</i> in. Nasty little place. Tight as a crab&#x2019;s arsehole.&#x201d;<br><br>I did not know if the captain was serious or not. There was certainly nothing I could do to help. The night was black as death and the fog almost too thick to breathe. Pretending I �wasn&#x2019;t there, I backed into a corner and watched and listened as Skipper Riggs and the helmsman took <i>Baccalieu</i> through a maze of reefs into an unseen and unseeable little harbour, then laid her alongside a wooden wharf that I never even saw until the lines went ashore and the fog-�diffused glow from a lamp on the shore told me we were there.<br><br>I remained on the bridge most of the rest of that black night so as not to miss the succeeding episodes of <i>Riggs Dares All</i> &#x2014; a harrowing life-�and-�death adventure in real time.<br><br>Coming in to La Poille two hours later, Riggs could not have been able to see much farther than the nose on his face. Furthermore, <i>Baccalieu</i>&#x2019;s searchlight was out of order and her old-�fashioned radar useless at close quarters. None of this seemed to concern Riggs as he paced rapidly back and forth, muttering to himself:<br><br>&#x201c;Oh you she-�cunt! Where&#x2019;s she going? Narrow place this . . . very narrow place. <i>Fucking</i> narrow place. �Can&#x2019;t turn her here. Oh hell, s&#x2019;pose I got to try.&#x201d;<br><br>Then, as the end of a dock miraculously appeared about ten feet off our bows: &#x201c;Never goin&#x2019; to make it. Lard <i>Jesus</i>, not going to make it!&#x201d;<br><br>When people on the dock began yelling that we were going to make a hole in their island, Riggs stepped out on the bridge wing and shouted back:<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;re you silly fuckers worryin&#x2019; about? We&#x2019;re right as houses! Finest kind!&#x201d;<br><br>With which he pulled the engine telegraph to full astern, and <i>Baccalieu</i> kissed the dock.<br><br>An hour later we continued on our way and, with the coming of a pallid dawn, Riggs turned the bridge over to the second mate and took me with him down to the saloon for breakfast.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll do, Little Man,&#x201d; he said over his fourth mug of tea. &#x201c;Long as you knows enough to keep your mouth shut when you&#x2019;re ignorant, you&#x2019;re welcome aboard of this one.&#x201d;<br><br>Through our subsequent friendship he continued to call me Little Man, and to treat me with the affectionate impatience he might have shown a slightly backward son. I learned a lot about Newfoundland and Newfoundlanders from Skipper Riggs.<br><br>A ruddy-�faced, burly lump of a man, Riggs had been born in the small settlement of Burin on the shores of Placentia Bay. He was as much a child of the sea as of the land. At the age of eight he had gone to the Grand Banks aboard a fishing schooner owned by an uncle. By the time he was twelve he had a berth as fo&#x2019;c&#x2019;sle hand, and at fifteen was fishing down the Labrador. At twenty he got his mate&#x2019;s papers and signed on aboard an English tramp freighter to spend the next several years travelling the world and, incidentally, picking up some of the worst of the argot used by British seamen. In 1936 he became the freighter&#x2019;s Master. In 1943 she was sunk under him by a German U-�boat. After the war, so he told me, he decided to &#x201c;settle down, so I married a maid from Fortune and, I supposes you could say, married the <i>Baccalieu</i> as well.&#x201d;<br><br>His was hardly a settled life. He had managed to get home for Christmas only once since 1946. His working schedule consisted of two months aboard his ship, followed by a month ashore. When he got home he was often unable to sleep, only able to doze with one ear cocked for trouble. He seldom slept while on board because the ship ran day and night and he was usually on the bridge, and always on call.<br><br>Although he could, and did, gorgeously curse the world around him, and everything in it including his beloved <i>Baccalieu</i>, he never seemed to have a hard word for any of his crew, though he had no patience with shore-�side management.<br><br>&#x201c;I got to keep the old bitch going come hell or high water, into and out of places a duck would leave alone. Places there �ain&#x2019;t even room to change your mind, and do it any time, day or night, in any kind of weather. They&#x2019;s got to be accidents, and there is. And when some damn fool thing goes wrong, the skipper gets suspension, whether he be at fault or no. But we �don&#x2019;t do it for they office fuckers in St. John&#x2019;s. We works for the people on the coast. The thanks we gits comes from them. I believe there&#x2019;s nothing on God&#x2019;s earth they �wouldn&#x2019;t do for we.

But the peace process begun by theKhitomer Accords is still fragile just as the deadly plans of what is believed to be a hard-line Klingon isolationist group violently come to fruition. <br><br>Yet the group thought responsible for the deadly attack has been dormant for decades, and its known modus operandi doesn&#x2019;t match up to the manner of the strike.

Presents arguments for ancient cultural contact between continents using mythology and archaeology, as well as evidence from human remains. Demonstrates ways in which the geological evidence of a catastrophic flood explains historical mysteries, and how the human historical evidence bolsters the geological theory of a catastrophic global flood.</p><p></p><h2>Once Upon a Time</h2><p>A struggling young reader triumphs<br><br>There is something worrying Sarie at school. Every time her teacher says, &#x201c;Children, take out your reading books,&#x201d; Sarie feels sick. The letters in the book all run together, tripping her up so that she stumbles and falters, and the girls in the back always make fun of her. Only Sarie&#x2019;s old friend, Auntie Anna, seems to understand that letters and words can be difficult things to grasp. And it is Auntie Anna, with the help of a book from her own daughter&#x2019;s childhood, who makes a unique Sunday ritual out of giving Sarie the help she needs, until the letters that were once her adversaries begin to seem friendly &#x2013; just in time for Sarie to prove herself to the laughing girls at school. <br><br>Niki Daly&#x2019;s illustrations set Sarie&#x2019;s tale under the vast and beautiful skies of the South African Karoo, and his encouraging story conveys the power and magic of a good book and the joy of having a good friend to share it with.<br></p><p>Niki Daly is the author and illustrator of many picture books, including <i>Old Bob&#x2019;s Brown Bear</i>, <i>What&#x2019;s Cooking, Jamela?</i>, and <i>Jamela&#x2019;s Dress</i>, an ALA Notable Book. He lives in Cape Town, South Africa.<br>Kindergarten-Grade 3-The long walk to school under the hot South African sky doesn't bother Sarie at all. It's the destination that troubles her, or more precisely, the classmates who giggle when she tries to read aloud and who later taunt her. On Sundays, she escapes to Auntie Anna's rusty, old car, and while Sarie pretends to drive, the two swap stories. When the child unearths a book from a crevice in the back seat, she reads it with the help of her aunt. Sarie thoroughly enjoys the Cinderella story, which Daly peoples with characters from the girl's life, a technique that portrays her connection to this reading experience with economy and style. Although Sarie continues to struggle in school, she has gained the self-assurance to carry on. The cycle of skill and confidence is set in motion, ultimately impacting her class performance. The author is as adept at conveying the anxiety that accompanies failure as he is at depicting the pride felt with success. Sarie tries envisioning the words in the school text as they appear when she's with her aunt: "-lots of friendly letters holding hands to form words that danced and sang together." The realistic watercolors contrast the shimmering vitality of the sun, Sarie, and Auntie Anna with the dusty earth and lackluster classmates. Endpapers of swirling letters suggest the story's theme. Those who pause long enough may see a message; readers at any stage will appreciate the struggle.<br><i>Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Light and Shadows: Church History amid Faith, Fact, and Legend</h2><p>The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, the Reformation, and the Renaissance popes conjure in the imagination a corrupt Roman Catholic clergy hungry for wealth and power. In this insightful, well researched work, the Vatican's chief historian, Fr. Walter Brandmuller, takes a thoughtful and understanding look at these and other important chapters in Church history. Without denying, or flinching at, the human capacity for folly, failure, and evil, Brandmuller moves beyond the caricatures and legends that often substitute for real history to reveal a Church, both human and divine, fulfilling its mission in every time and place. His goal is not to whitewash any of these past events or issues, but rather to illuminate them, and bring to them a more in-depth, comprehensive historical understanding on the basis of their causes, circumstances and effects. <p>Now let us take into consideration Church history from the theological viewpoint, highlighting another important aspect. Its essential duty, in fact, turns out to be the complex mission to investigate and clarify that process of reception and transmission, of paralepsis and of paradosis, through which was substantiated, in the course of the ages, the Church's raison d'etre. Indeed, it is beyond a doubt that the Church can draw inspiration for her choices by drawing on her centuries-old treasury of experience and memory.<br><b> Pope Benedict VXI</b>, Address to the members of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences, March 7, 2008</p></p><p></p><h2>Art of Seed Beading</h2><p>Every stitch, from peyote to brick; every technique, from knitting to weaving; and every type of bead, from seed to bugle: that&#39;s what you&#39;ll find in this incredible and thorough introduction to the art of seed beading. If you&#39;re a beginner, you&#39;ll get all the basics. If you have a little more experience, you&#39;re sure to encounter some new and creative ideas to try out. Hundreds of pictures display sparkling beads in a variety of colors and styles, and charts show every move you&#39;ll have to make with your needle.</p><p>Jane Davis has written a dozen books, many of which have become top sellers.Beading books tend to concentrate on one technique and ignore or only briefly mention other ones. Here, three very new authors combine their talents to present a wealth of methodologies and an abundance of projects. For each project, instructions come first. And after breezing through a history and overview of equipment, the authors emphasize the how-to in such stitches as peyote and herringbone and such elaborate processes as tubular beaded crochet. Every one of the more than 25 projects focuses on a specific tool or technique, complete with color graphs, list of materials, size and measurements, a color photo, and diagrams whenever apropriate. Although directions for fashioning, say, a Victorian ivy-leaf charm bracelet or an elephant eloquence necklace are presented with plenty of details, beginners at least will need a jeweler's loupe or extra-strength magnifying glass to decipher the initial information.

Contributions reflects Heidegger&#x2019;s struggle to think at the edge of words and to bring to language what remains beyond the written or the spoken. In view of the centrality of Being and Time to Heidegger interpretation in recent decades, Vallega-Neu introduces Contributions first by reconsidering Being and Time in light of the transformative turn from prepositional thought to the poietic, performative character of thinking and language that marks the passage between the two works. She then discusses each of the "joinings" that structure the composition of Contributions. This graceful introduction provides students and scholars with a much-needed key for unlocking the thinking that underlies Heidegger&#x2019;s later writings.</p></p><p><p>Daniela Vallega-Neu is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at California State University, Stanislaus.

Trotsky employs facts, figures, and statistics to show how Stalinist policies rejected the enormous productive potential of the nationalized planned economy engendered by the October Revolution.</p><p>Leon Trotsky (7 November [O.S. 26 October] 1879 &#x2013; 21 August 1940) was a Marxist revolutionary and theorist, a Soviet politician who engineered the transfer of all political power to the Soviets with the October Revolution of 1917, and the founding leader of the Red Army. Trotsky initially supported the Menshevik Internationalists faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He joined the Bolsheviks just before the 1917 October Revolution, and eventually became a leader within the Communist Party. He was, alongside Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Bubnov, one of the seven members of the first Politburo, founded in 1917 to manage the Bolshevik Revolution. During the early days of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the Soviet Union, he served first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army, with the title of People's Commissar of Military and Naval Affairs. He was a major figure in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War (1918&#x2013;1923). After leading a failed struggle of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and against the increasing role of bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, Trotsky was removed from power (October 1927), expelled from the Communist Party (November 1927), exiled to Alma&#x2013;Ata (January 1928), and exiled from the Soviet Union (February 1929). As the head of the Fourth International, Trotsky continued to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union from exile. On Stalin's orders, he was assassinated in Mexico in August 1940 by Ram�n Mercader, a Spanish-born Soviet agent. Trotsky's ideas formed the basis of Trotskyism, a major school of Marxist thought that opposes the theories of Stalinism. He was written out of the history books under Stalin, and was one of the few Soviet political figures who were not rehabilitated by the government under Nikita Khrushchev in the 1950s. It was not until the late 1980s that his books were released for publication in the Soviet Union, which dissolved a short time later.</p><h2>the lake has no saint</h2><p>Poetry. LGBT Studies. Winner of Tupelo Press&#39;s Snowbound Chapbook Award selected by Dana Levin. Stacey Waite&#39;s THE LAKE HAS NO SAINT is a study in grief--a work of poetic archaeology that traces the artifacts of the past into the relationships of the present. Embedded in a powerfully modulated sequence addressing a &#34;you&#34; who shifts in location and identity, many of these poems feel like forms of request, imploring. The speaker&#39;s androgynous self-awareness--and wary attention to the gendered assumptions elicited by bodies--disclose in each poem a recognizable but disorienting (and pressurized) situation. THE LAKE HAS NO SAINT will unsettle a reader&#39;s sense of the certainty and stability of gender, as grammar and phrasing are also disrupted and blurred, often requiring us to read closely to hear where one sentence ends as another begins. Yet despite its formal and thematic iconoclasm, this is a book that clearly elucidates a story both heart-rending and ultimately--in its vatic honesty--triumphant.</p><p>Stacey Waite is originally from Long Island, New York. S/he majored in English at Bucknell University and earned an M.F.A. in poetry from the University of Pittsburgh. S/he now teaches courses in Composition, Gender Studies, and Literature and Creative Writing as a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh.

Mercator was the greatest and most ingenious cartographer of them all: it was he who coined the word &#x2018;atlas&#x2019; and solved the riddle of converting the three-dimensional globe into a two-dimensional map while retaining true compass bearings. It is Mercator&#x2019;s Projection that NASA are using today to map Mars. <p>How did Mercator reconcile his religious beliefs with a science that would make Christian maps obsolete?

At the centre of this exploratory vortex were the cartographers who were painstakingly piecing together the evidence that would create a complete picture of the planet. Mercator was the greatest of them all - a poor cobbler's boy who attended one of Europe's top universities, was persecuted and imprisoned by the Inquisition, yet survived to produce his eponymous projection and to coin the term 'atlas'. Devoutly religious, yet gripped by the quest for geographical truth, Mercator struggled to reconcile the two, a conflict mirrored by the clash in Europe between humanism and the Church. </p><p>Mercator solved the dimensional riddle that had vexed cosmographers for so long: How could the three-dimensional globe be converted into a two-dimensional map while retaining true compass bearings?

When he set out from Paris to venture into the heart of Africa, Harris, an African-American, aimed not to find his roots but to follow the line ``that connects that place with this one, the place we came from and the place we find ourselves, those lives and our lives.'' What he found was a place that infuriated him, moved him, and, ultimately, enlightened him. As Harris traveled through Tunisia, crossed the Sahara desert into Mali, and ventured on through Zaire to Zimbabwe and South Africa, he learned that in a continent where tribal and religious allegiances are more significant than race--though that can never be discounted--he was still the stranger, the rich American and not the fellow black. Congenitally friendly, Harris met and stayed with a representative mix of locals, but the cumulative effect of overwhelming poverty, government corruption, endemic passivity, and officious bureaucracy--he was thrown in jail in Liberia--was finally too much. In Zaire, on a crowded river boat, he realized that ``I didn't know where I belonged. It was so strange to be among so many black people and to have so much more in common with the handful of whites'' aboard. Harris has no answers to this dilemma: ``Africa is contradiction, and Africa brings out the contradictions in the traveler....My skin is black, my culture is not.'' All that matters, in the end, is the human connection. A book of travel in the best tradition, in which the exploration of self and place ends, as all great journeys should, in the attainment of a little wisdom--and hope.

With this <i>Grim Fandango</i> guide, however, the walkthrough is the story, so even if you follow it to the letter and play the game with your eyes firmly glued to the book (and not on the screen) you'll still absorb some of the splendor that makes <i>Grim Fandango</i> such an impressive, unique, and compelling gaming experience. <i>--Michael Ryan</i>Of all the travel agents in all the cities of the afterworld, the trouble had to happen to Manny.</p><h2>Outpost (Donovan)</h2><p><b>From the bestselling co-author of the People novels comes a riveting science fiction adventure on a planet with danger around every corner</b><br><br>Donovan is a world of remarkable wealth, a habitable paradise of a planet. It sounds like a dream come true. But Donovan's wealth comes at a price.<br><br> When the ship <i>Turalon</i> arrives in orbit, Supervisor Kalico Aguila discovers a failing colony, its government overthrown and the few remaining colonists now gone wild. Donovan offers the chance of a lifetime, one that could leave her the most powerful woman in the solar system. Or dead.<br><br> Planetside, Talina Perez is one of three rulers of the Port Authority colony&#x2014;the only law left in the one remaining town on Donovan. With the Corporate ship demanding answers about the things she's done in the name of survival, Perez could lose everything, including her life.<br><br> For Dan Wirth, Donovan is a last chance. A psychopath with a death sentence looming over his head, he can't wait to set foot on Port Authority. He will make one desperate play to grab a piece of the action&#x2014;no matter who he has to corrupt, murder, or destroy.<br><br> Captain Max Taggart has been The Corporation's "go-to" guy when it comes to brutal enforcement. As the situation in Port Authority deteriorates, he'll be faced with tough choices to control the wild Donovanians. Only Talina Perez stands in his way.<br><br> Just as matters spiral out of control, a ghost ship, the <i>Freelander</i>, appears in orbit. Missing for two years, she arrives with a crew dead of old age, and reeks of a bizarre death-cult ritual that deters any ship from attempting a return journey. And in the meantime, a brutal killer is stalking all of them, for Donovan plays its own complex and deadly game. The secrets of which are hidden in Talina Perez's very blood.</p><p>It's like coming home and finding the house full of magic and discovery.&nbsp;<i>Outpost&nbsp;</i>is a good old-fashioned sf novel that I've wanted to write for decades. For years I've been crafting my share of the "People" books, utilizing my anthropological background to recreate vanished worlds. All that time the world of Donovan has been brewing in the back of my mind as an itch that couldn't be scratched. &nbsp;Folks, I&nbsp;<i>ached</i>&nbsp;to write this series!Like all good sf, it asks questions that only the reader can answer. For example, if you were on a world where chances were overwhelming that you'd be eaten alive, would you choose to leave if chances were one in five that you'd ever seen Earth again. And if you didn't it would mean death somewhere lost in alien space? &nbsp;What's the best of a bad situation? Additionally I've been able to use my biological training, my years of working with bison, and living on the edge of American wilderness to craft what I hope is a wonderful new world. One filled with wealth and danger. Think of&nbsp;<i>Outpost&nbsp;</i>as&nbsp;<i>Avatar&nbsp;</i>meets&nbsp;<i>Deadwood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>I hope that you enjoy&nbsp;<i>Outpost&nbsp;</i>and its sequels&nbsp;and look forward to your reviews here on Amazon.&nbsp;<b>W.

But Amenhotep IV appoints him Great Royal Scribe, and he is soon surrounded by bitterly envious rivals and enemies.</p><p>The child-princess Mutnodjme sees her beautiful sister Nefertiti married off to the impotent young Amenhotep.

But a far greater menace impends.</p><p>The newly renamed Akhnaten plans to suppress the worship of all other gods in the Black Land. His horrified court soon realize that the Pharaoh is not merely deformed, but irretrievably mad; and that the greatest danger to the Empire is in the royal palace itself.</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Greenwood, the Australian author of the Phryne Fisher and Corinna Chapman mystery series, heads off in a radical new direction. Her new novel is set in ancient Egypt around the time of Nefertiti and Tutankhamen and concerns itself with a pharaoh&#x2019;s grand&#x2014;some might say megalomaniacal&#x2014;plan to change the religious landscape of the country. There are also several subplots winding themselves in and around the main story (Nefertiti figures prominently in one), and the story is told in roughly alternating fashion by a pair of young scribes, one of them a sister to Nefertiti, the other a lower-class boy who dreams of a better life. Greenwood has taken a big risk here. Ancient Egypt as a source of literary material has been pretty well mined. But the novel feels fresh, partly because Greenwood isn&#x2019;t insisting on shoehorning a traditional mystery plot into the book. She&#x2019;s working on a much broader, epic scale that almost suggests Norman Mailer&#x2019;s Ancient Evenings (1983). A real change of pace, but the majority of the author&#x2019;s fans won&#x2019;t be disappointed. --David Pitt</p><h2>Prairie Du Chien: French, British, American</h2><p>Unabridged, unaltered republication of the second (1949) edition.

Poets ranging from Shakespeare to Alice Oswald have found it the perfect choice for the expression of intense but controlled feelings. Beginning with Wyatt and ending in the present day,<em>The Oxford Book of Sonnets</em> is a unique treasury of memorable sonnet reflections on love and life.<br> In a beautiful one-poem-per-page design, Shakespeare's marriage of true minds rubs shoulders with John Davies of Herefrod's the late ABC of love, Keats' stout Cortez with Darley's Manrique. Women poets who revived the sonnet in eighteenth century are restored to prominence, and modern poets as diverse as Seamus Heaney, Carol Ann Duffy, and Simon Armitage are well represented. After an expository introduction that traces the sonnet in English from its appearance in the Tudor Court of the sixteenth century through its various historical reinterpretations and eras of popularity, 328 sonnets are arranged in order of the birth date of the poets. Thus, readers have a formidable guide to both the evolution of sonnet writing in English and the distinct voices of major and minor poets that have accepted the form's challenges and expressive power. This book also includes examples of the sonnet sequence as well as more unusual experimentation with form such as Sylvester's quadruple acrostic sonnets to his patron and Leigh Hunt's <em>Iterating Sonnet.</em><br> In addition to the aforementioned poets, this collection includes sterling works by Sir Philip Sidney, George Chapman, John Donne, Lady Mary Wroth, George Herbert, John Milton, Aphra Behn, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Matthew Arnold, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Christina Rossetti, Thomas Hardy, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Oscar Wilde, William Butler Yeats, Robert Frost, Siegrfried Sassoon, Edna St Vincent Millay, Aldous Huxley, Dylan Thomas, Derek Walcott, Seamus Heaney, and many more.</p><p><br>John Fuller, a fellow of Magdalen College, is a well known anthologiser, novelist and poet, with good trade/media profile. He has writen five novels, 13 volumes of poetry, and editied several anthologies including the Chatto Book of Love Poetry.<br>The word <i>new</i> is missing from the title of Oxford's latest anthology, and perhaps this is the venerable publisher's first survey of the sonnet in English. It seems a companionable reader rather than a teaching text, which is only right, in view of the 14-line poetic form's reputation for intimacy and personality. Fuller doesn't neglect the sonnet's historical variations in mode and prosodic practice. The early sonnet's amorousness; the political and religious intents of the sonnets of Milton and those he inspired, most notably Wordsworth; the satire of the numerically rare eighteenth-century sonnet; the celebration of nature in the sonnets of the Romantic period; the Victorians' propensity for compact sonnet sequences; and Hopkins' radical experimentation with the form--all these and their subsequent influences are evident in Fuller's selection. Indisputable masterpieces appear plentifully, but Fuller's determination to present a large number of distinguished practitioners assures that there are also many superb poems by virtual unknowns. And Fuller's introduction is a sharp-witted miracle of concise comprehensiveness. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Among the passengers and crew were celebrated CBS journalist Eric Sevareid, an OSS operative who was also a Soviet double agent, and General Joseph "Vinegar Joe" Stilwell's personal political adviser. Against the odds, all but one of the twenty-one people aboard the doomed aircraft survived-it remains the largest civilian evacuation of an aircraft by parachute. But they fell from the frying pan into the fire.<br><br>Disentangling themselves from their parachutes, the shocked survivors discovered that they had arrived in wild country dominated by a tribe with a special reason to hate white men. The Nagas were notorious headhunters who routinely practiced slavery and human sacrifice, their specialty being the removal of enemy heads. Japanese soldiers lay close by, too, with their own brand of hatred for Americans.<br><br><i>Among the Headhunters</i> tells-for the first time-the incredible true story of the adventures of these men among the Naga warriors, their sustenance from the air by the USAAF, and their ultimate rescue.

The day before, her Sedona-based insurance agency where she was the office manager had been shut down by agents from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Her boss, Dan Frazier, had given her no advance warning that the raid was coming. In the hours since, she&#x2019;d tried reaching out to him over and over&#x2014;to no avail. He wasn&#x2019;t taking her calls, and as far as she knew, he hadn&#x2019;t tried calling her, either. Without hearing from Dan or having some kind of direction from him, she had no idea what she was supposed to do next. What was she was supposed to tell her employees, to say nothing of the firm&#x2019;s anxious clients?<br> <br>Try as she might, Haley still couldn&#x2019;t make sense of what had happened. Late in the afternoon, a group of men in suits had walked into the Frazier Insurance Agency and paused in front of the receptionist&#x2019;s desk. Although Haley didn&#x2019;t recognize the new arrivals, at first nothing seemed amiss. She assumed they were new in town and in the market for some kind of insurance coverage. As they continued to speak to Carmen Rios, the receptionist, however, Haley noticed the young woman growing more and more agitated. Finally, sensing something out of the ordinary, Haley left her own desk toward the back of the room and walked up to Carmen&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m the office manager here,&#x201d; she said, focusing on the man who seemed to be in charge. &#x201c;Is there something I can do for you gentlemen?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They claim they&#x2019;re from the SEC,&#x201d; Carmen whispered, sounding worried. &#x201c;They say we have to close the office immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The SEC?&#x201d; Haley asked. &#x201c;You want us to close the office? What&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man standing directly in front of Carmen turned to Haley and extracted an ID wallet from his pocket. When he held it up for Haley&#x2019;s examination, she saw that it belonged to one Donald Ferris, a senior agent with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<br> <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I see that you&#x2019;re with the SEC, but I have no idea what that means or why you feel it&#x2019;s necessary to shut down my office. What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My understanding is that Daniel Frazier Jr. is the owner of this establishment. Correct?&#x201d; the guy asked.<br> <br>Haley nodded. &#x201c;Yes, but he isn&#x2019;t in right now. If you&#x2019;d like to leave a card&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ignoring her objection, Agent Ferris continued. &#x201c;Mr. Frazier is also a duly registered representative of a firm called Ocotillo Fund Management, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; Haley began, &#x201c;but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ocotillo Fund Management initiated bankruptcy proceedings earlier this afternoon. We&#x2019;ve been directed to shut down this office and take custody of any and all applicable files. Since some of your insurance customers are also investment clients, we&#x2019;ll be taking them all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking our files?&#x201d; Haley echoed. &#x201c;As for Ocotillo Fund Management filing bankruptcy? This is the first I&#x2019;ve heard anything about it. Besides, you can&#x2019;t just walk in here like you own the place. Do you have a warrant?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny you should ask,&#x201d; Agent Ferris said, producing a document from an inside pocket of his suit jacket and handing it over. &#x201c;You and your employees are to clear the premises at once. You may take personal items&#x2014;purses, cell phones, tablets, and such, but all company files and equipment are to remain here. If anyone attempts to remove files via something like a thumb drive or other device, they will be found and confiscated as you exit.&#x201d;<br> <br>When he said the words &#x201c;thumb drive,&#x201d; Haley remembered briefly that Millie Frazier, Dan&#x2019;s wife, had stopped by the office on Friday morning. She had seemed exasperated and more than a little put out. &#x201c;I had two appointments down in Paradise Valley later today, but Dan insisted that I cancel both of them and drive all the way up here to put this in the safe-deposit box,&#x201d; she had grumbled, holding up a postage stamp&#x2013;sized object.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Haley had asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;A kind of thumb drive,&#x201d; Millie said. &#x201c;I forget the real name&#x2014;micro something or other. A memory card, maybe. Dan says he has an adapter here that&#x2019;ll make it work in his dinosaur desktop. As for why he needed this little item to be in the bank this morning rather than later today or maybe even tomorrow morning? I have no idea. Anyway, you know how Dan is. Once he gets an idea in his head, it&#x2019;s &#x2018;my way or the highway.&#x2019; So that&#x2019;s my next stop&#x2014;the bank.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know thumb drives could be that small,&#x201d; Haley said, &#x201c;but it must be important.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Something to do with work, I expect,&#x201d; Millie allowed. &#x201c;Something he doesn&#x2019;t want falling into the wrong hands. How are things here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; Haley had told her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad to hear it,&#x201d; Millie had said, then she was gone.<br> <br>Standing there facing down Agent Donald Ferris, Millie Frazier and her tiny memory card were the least of Haley&#x2019;s worries.<br> <br>&#x201c;Before you or your people touch a thing,&#x201d; she said, reaching for her cell, &#x201c;I need to check with Mr. Frazier.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Agent Ferris insisted. &#x201c;This warrant says otherwise. Now if you and your people will gather all your belongings and clear out, we&#x2019;ll be able to get started.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is outrageous. You can&#x2019;t just shut us down.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, we can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For how long?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For as long as it takes&#x2014;maybe indefinitely. We&#x2019;ll be sorting through the material tonight and deciding what&#x2019;s to stay and what&#x2019;s to go. We&#x2019;ll send a truck here tomorrow to pick up what&#x2019;s going. In the meantime, I&#x2019;ve called a locksmith.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re changing the locks?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am. Once you leave here, no one&#x2019;s allowed back inside until we give the go-ahead. Presumably, you&#x2019;re in charge, so I&#x2019;ll need your contact information.&#x201d;<br> <br>With the phone pressed to one ear, Haley listened as her call to Dan&#x2019;s cell phone again went unanswered. &#x201c;Call me,&#x201d; she said when the voice mail recording came on.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time,&#x201d; Agent Ferris said. &#x201c;We need to get started.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had taken only a couple of minutes for the eight office employees&#x2014;Haley included&#x2014;to gather up their goods and be herded into the parking lot, with all purses having been thoroughly inspected on the way out. Naturally everybody was upset, and a couple of the girls were crying. What was going on? Did they still have jobs? What were they going to do?<br> <br>Haley had done her best to be reassuring to the others, but that was a tough act to maintain, especially when a locksmith showed up in a van and proceeded to change the locks on the doors, both front and back, rendering Haley&#x2019;s prized master key useless.<br> <br>While the locksmith worked, Haley had continued to try to reach Dan. There was still no answer at any of Dan&#x2019;s numbers, but she finally left brief messages on all three. &#x201c;Please call me. Agents from the SEC came by and shut down the office. I need to know what&#x2019;s going on. Call me when you can. I&#x2019;m worried.&#x201d; As a last resort, she tried Millie&#x2019;s cell phone, too. There was no answer there, either, and Haley left yet another message.<br> <br>Gradually the other women drifted away to their cars. Haley stayed on, watching through the windows as a crew of workers dismantled the office. Computer terminals and keyboards were removed from desks and left in a heap near the front door. She was horrified to see the files from her superefficient wall-mounted and color-coded filing system be summarily tossed into a collection of empty Bankers Boxes and carted over to the door in no particular order. Had Agent Ferris allowed Haley to participate, she could have pointed out that files with blue tabs indicated investment clients only. Green and blue meant the customers had both investment and insurance accounts, while files with solo green tabs indicated insurance customers only.<br> <br>Watching the haphazard way things were stuffed into boxes and stacked in random piles left Haley sick at heart. Once the files were returned, it would take days to sort them and put things back to rights. If ever.<br> <br>What if the files never did come back? What if the demise of Ocotillo Fund Management spelled the end for the Frazier Insurance Agency as well? What if, rather than being a temporary measure, the office ended up being shut down for good? What would happen to her and to the other women who had worked there? During a mostly sleepless night, while fruitlessly checking her phone for incoming texts from Dan or Millie, Haley had wrestled with that question both for herself and for the others. What would become of them?<br> <br>As far as Haley was concerned, the Frazier Insurance Agency was the only place she had ever worked. Like little Carmen Rios at the reception desk, Haley had gone to work for Dan Frazier straight out of high school. Almost two decades later, she was the office manager and the beneficiary of a business continuation plan that would allow her to buy the business outright in the event of either Dan&#x2019;s retirement or death. But what if the business was wiped out completely? Where would she go then? With her experience and with professional designations to back it up, she supposed some other insurance company would hire her, but working for someone else wasn&#x2019;t something to look forward to.<br> <br>Haley&#x2019;s childhood had been chaotic at best. She had seldom ended a school year in the same school or even the same district where the year had started. The best thing her druggie mother ever did for her was to leave. As an awkward seventh-grader, Haley had been dumped into the care and keeping of her grandmother, Carol Hotchkiss. Not only was she an outsider in her new surroundings, she was also terribly behind as far as academics were concerned. Nonetheless, under her grandmother&#x2019;s tutelage Haley had come into her own.<br> <br>Carol had spent her adult life working as a secretary for a local attorney, and she had deemed that what had been good for her would be good for Haley as well. Carol had insisted that Haley learn to type, teaching her at home on an aged Toshiba laptop. She had also taught Haley the intricacies of shorthand&#x2014;something that was no longer offered in high school.<br> <br>Once out of high school, those basic but increasingly rare secretarial skills had been enough to get her an entry-level job with Dan Frazier. Eighteen years later, nearly forty, Haley was married to her job. At Dan&#x2019;s insistence, Haley had earned her CLU, CPCU, and ChFC designations, and those had been sufficient for Dan to promote her to office manager. For years her duties had also included many of the functions more in line with those of a personal assistant. Once Dan had joined forces with Ocotillo Fund Management, however, Haley&#x2019;s PA duties had been passed along to corporate hires down in Phoenix.<br> <br>Jason McKinzie had insisted that, as an executive with the firm, Dan have a full-time PA in Phoenix rather than a part-time one ninety miles away. The latest of these was Jessica Denton, someone Haley regarded as little more than a BBB&#x2014;blond, bombshell bimbo&#x2014;words Haley never uttered aloud. Jessie, as she liked to be called, may have been long on looks, but she seemed to be short on everything else, including shorthand and typing skills. Her occasional telephone conversations with Haley reeked of condescension.<br> <br>It hadn&#x2019;t taken long for Haley to resent this latest unwelcome addition, but thank goodness, Jessie was Phoenix-centric. She seldom ventured far from the city, and when Dan was back home in Sedona, it was easy for Haley to ignore Jessica&#x2019;s existence entirely and fall back into the comfortable old ways of doing things&#x2014;and running occasional errands when needed. Regarding Dan&#x2019;s Sedona-based clientele? At this point Haley knew his local customers far better than he did.<br> <br>But was that enough? Haley wondered. If Frazier Insurance had come to the end of the road, would her intimate knowledge of the business and her years of faithful service make it possible for her transition to a comparable job somewhere else?<br> <br>Although Haley was wide awake and had been for hours, she started when her alarm went off. Scrambling out of bed, she realized that, by now, the failure of Ocotillo Fund Management was probably not only public knowledge but a hot topic of conversation all over town. Even though the office would be closed, Haley&#x2019;s sense of responsibility prodded her to dress for work. After all, someone needed to be there to provide a company presence not only for concerned customers but also for whoever the SEC was sending to retrieve the Bankers Boxes packed with files.<br> <br>Dressed and with her makeup on, Haley headed for the kitchen, where she turned on the coffeepot and prepared to make the oatmeal that Gram insisted on having for breakfast summer and winter. While waiting for the water to boil, Haley switched on the television set in the living room, coming into the news broadcast just as someone mentioned Ocotillo Fund Management. By the time the segment was over, Haley was frozen in her grandmother&#x2019;s recliner and on the verge of hyperventilating. The broadcast moved on to a commercial break, but Haley stared unseeing at the figures on the screen with a storm of questions flashing through her mind. How had this happened? And would her office be able to weather the storm.<br> <br>By the time Haley staggered back into the kitchen, the water in the saucepan had mostly boiled away. As she started over on the oatmeal, she recalled one bit from the broadcast that had hit her especially hard&#x2014;the quote from an unnamed source, reportedly a former OFM employee, who claimed that the bankruptcy proceedings had come as a complete surprise to everyone.<br> <br>That couldn&#x2019;t be true, Haley realized. Dan must have known. Had to have known. She had worked with the man long enough that she understood his moods, both good and bad. It seemed to her that he&#x2019;d been in a dark place recently&#x2014;for the past several months, anyway. Now with the bankruptcy issue out in the open, she thought she understood why. He must have realized that there was trouble brewing with the SEC. Still, it hurt more than Haley could fathom that this man she had trusted so completely&#x2014;someone who had been the only thing close to a father figure in her life&#x2014;hadn&#x2019;t confided in her or given her so much as a single word of warning that disaster was looming. It was one thing for him to do that to relative strangers, but how could he do that to her?<br> <br>The oatmeal was almost ready to serve when she heard the click, click, click of her grandmother&#x2019;s walker coming down the hall. Haley reached for the remote to silence the TV set.<br> <br>&#x201c;Morning,&#x201d; Gram said, easing herself onto her chair and placing her walker off to the side. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother turning it off,&#x201d; she added. &#x201c;I was watching the news in my room before I came out. Have you heard from Dan?&#x201d;<br> <br>Haley shook her head. &#x201c;Not a word.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Asshole,&#x201d; Gram muttered as Haley placed a cup of coffee and a bowl of steaming oatmeal in front of her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d think he&#x2019;d at least have the decency to call you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d think,&#x201d; Haley agreed, taking her own seat.<br> <br>Despite whatever pitfalls the coming day might hold, Haley couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at her grandmother&#x2019;s plainspoken opinion, but then, Carol Hotchkiss had never been one to hold back. Two years ago, Haley&#x2019;s mother had dropped by for an unexpected and unwelcome visit, making her first appearance after an almost thirty-year absence.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t give a rat&#x2019;s ass about either one of us,&#x201d; Grandma C. had told her errant daughter. &#x201c;You may think you can show up after all these years and hope to hang around long enough for me to die so you can pick my bones. Well, my dear, you&#x2019;ve got another think coming. Haley and I are doing just fine without you, thank yo...</p><h2>Medicine Wheels: Ancient Teachings for Modern Times</h2><p>This illuminating guide to the Native American ritual of the Medicine Wheel makes an ancient spiritual practice available to everyone.

Beginning at Hite, Utah, the site of an old pioneer camp, and following the course of the river through the canyon to Lees Ferry, this book leisurely takes in the sweeping views and labyrinthine side canyons that make the wondrous place that was Glen Canyon. The long 162-mile-long stretch of river through the canyon chronicles the natural history of southeastern Utah and the human history as well. Anasazi ruins and mining camps, heron colonies and hanging gardens, reflecting pools and tapestry walls are here magnificently recalled. With his photographs, writings from diaries kept during his years on the river, and recollections, Tad Nichols takes us on a journey&#x2015;no longer possible today&#x2015;through the heart of canyon country. This book is what remains of one of the last great wilderness experiences.</p><p>In the early 1960s the federal government announced a plan to control the Colorado River by building a series of hydroelectric dams. The plan set off a storm of protest. The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit, arguing that one of those dams, to be built at the entrance to the Grand Canyon, would mean the destruction of Glen Canyon, a jewel-like oasis, one of the most beautiful natural wonders of the desert Southwest. But the lawsuit failed, and the dam was built, resulting in the formation of 200-mile-long Lake Powell, one of the largest artificial bodies of water on the planet--and in the inundation of Glen Canyon, which environmentalists called "the place no one knew."<p> Photographer and filmmaker Tad Nichols did know Glen Canyon, so well that many of the area's place names are the ones that he and his fellow explorers and friends gave them. In this stunning book of documentary photography, Nichols takes readers on a voyage down the Colorado River, traversing stone labyrinths, wild rapids, and narrow beaches. Accompanied by entries from his travel journals of the 1950s and early '60s, his photographs show us just how much was lost when Glen Canyon receded beneath Lake Powell's waters--and what we stand to regain if, as advocates hope, Glen Canyon Dam is dismantled and the Colorado River is allowed to flow freely once again. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>As a photographer with a background in geology and anthropology, <strong>Tad Nichols</strong> (1911-2000) participated in scientific expeditions that led him from Mexico's Par�cutin Volcano to the sand dunes of Africa.

But despite one's good intentions, the life-enhancing abundance heaped on our children often becomes more than they need or can handle, and the line is crossed into overindulgence. In How Much is Enough?, best-selling parenting and family experts Clarke, Dawson, and Bredehoft offer an in-depth look at how damaging overindulgence is to children, affecting their ability to learn many of the important life skills they need to thrive as adults. In warm and empathetic language, the authors reveal the three different ways children are overindulged (giving too much, being over-nurturing, and providing soft structure), guide parents in determining whether they're doing something overindulgent, and show them how to do things differently. The truth is that overindulgence is not the badge of a bad parent; in fact, it comes directly from having a good and generous heart. Based on solid, groundbreaking research involving 1,200 parents and their children, How Much is Enough? gives parents the insight and advice they need to parent in an effective and loving way and put their children on track for a happy and successful life.</p><p>A down-to-earth guide to finding the right balance between helping your kids and overindulging themJEAN ILLSLEY CLARKE, PH.D., is an internationally known parent educator whose books include Self-Esteem and Growing Up Again.

Later freed negroes agitating for abolition became more prominent, and the founding in 1827 of <i>Freedom's Journal</i> provided a literary outlet for their work. After reconstruction, a network of black colleges and the proliferation of black newspapers and magazines secured a solid base for an intellectual life that today is thriving more than ever before.William M.

She knows that she's a disappointment to her elegant, ambitious mother who focuses all her attention on Amanda's charming older brother, Dale. Her mother is obsessed with getting Dale into an Ivy League college, although Dale protests that neither his grades nor his athletic skills are sufficient for the scholarship he would need. Amanda feels truly loved only when Pink Pig, a beloved figurine, transports her into Little World, a magical place inhabited by Amanda's collection of miniatures. At school, even Amanda's best friend Libby is made uneasy by Amanda's assertions that Pink Pig is "real." When Pink Pig is lost, Amanda finds herself turning increasingly to Pearly, the school's janitor who is also her grandmother. Amanda's mother has forbidden any contact with Pearly, partially out of bitterness against the husband who deserted her and partly because Pearly is uneducated and "common." Amanda sees only the kindness and love Pearly offers her, a love which gives Amanda the courage to face the devastating changes which threaten both her worlds. This sensitive story should appeal to children who have suffered from the "lonelies." The fantasy element is entertaining but childlike; it is clear that Amanda's adventures come from her own imagination and need. Readers will share Amanda's triumph and grief when she is able to say goodbye to Pink Pig and move on. Eleanor K. MacDonald, University Elementary School Library, Los Angeles<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.Adler's new novel ranks with her earlier works, including The Magic of the Glits, as a moving and many-faceted story about extremely well-created characters. Amanda Bickett, 10, relies on Pink Piga tiny carving in rose quartzfor understanding companionship. Her brother Dale is loving and attentive but much older than Amanda. He's the apple of his snobbish mother's eye; Mrs. Bickett pins hopes for status on Dale's anticipated collegiate triumphs and she's distanced from her daughter, so much like her late father, timid and weak. Amanda's conviction that Pink Pig is alive takes her, fugue-like, into its Little World where she dares to confront the wizard that's destroying the miniatures in her collection. Encouraged by besting the wicked one, Amanda becomes friendly with Pearly, the elderly janitor at school, whom the girl's mother had forbidden her to recognize. Pearly is grandmother to Amanda and Dale but their mother had never admitted ties to the "common woman." She turns out, however, to be an uncommon help to her grandchildren when Mrs. Bickett's warped viewpoint causes more trouble in real life than Amanda's escapes into the Little World. This is not a happy-ever-after ending; it's the promise of better days for those who have learned to cope and have gained a sense of values. <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Basic Psychic Development: A User's Guide to Auras, Chakra &amp; Clairvoyance</h2><p>The key to psychic development and spiritual healing lies in understanding your aura. The authors explain how to work with the two major types of aura limitations: blocks and boundary issues. Combining both Eastern and Western traditions, using a variety of techniques ranging from meditation and breathing exercises to chakra therapy, you'll learn how to get rid of blocks and clarify identity boundaries. With bibliography &amp; index.</p><p>Based heavily on the work of Lewis Bostwick, founder of the Berkeley Psychic Institute, <i>Basic Psychic Development</i> is a complete learning system for would-be psychics. Rather than closing oneself to outside energies, Friedlander's system encourages an open, playful approach to experiencing the energies around us with new tools like auras, chakras, and clairvoyance. While the premise of <i>Basic Psychic Development</i> is to advance awareness, understanding, and control over one's psychic abilities, the ultimate goal is individuation--owning one's identity--something more valuable than any psychic ability. --<i>Brian Patterson</i>John Friedlander graduated from Duke University and Harvard Law School, and studied with Lewis Bostwick at the Berkley Psychic Institute in California.

The Cloud puts forth a method of contemplation that stresses the impotence of the understanding to break through the cloud of unknowing that separates God and humanity. Rather, "it is love alone that can reach God in this life". </p><p>In his preface to this volume, Simon Tugwell sums up the challenge that the author of The Cloud presents us today: "If we wish to follow him, we must be prepared to be taxed to the limit. But if we have the courage and the ability to follow him, we shall not find that our efforts has been in vain."</p></p><p></p><h2>Art Ideas (Usborne Art Ideas)</h2><p>Offers creative ideas for all kinds of art projects and teaches about brushes, papers, special effects, and using different paints, pastels, inks, crayons, and other media.</p><p>More than 200 art projects are explained in step-by-step, detailed instructions to inspire the artist in every child and in nearly every medium.

Flawed government policy and unscrupulous personal and corporate behavior in the United States created the current financial meltdown, which was exported across the globe with devastating consequences. The crisis has sparked an essential debate about America&#x2019;s economic missteps, the soundness of this country&#x2019;s economy, and even the appropriate shape of a capitalist system.<br><br> Few are more qualified to comment during this turbulent time than Joseph E. Stiglitz. Winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics, Stiglitz is &#x201c;an insanely great economist, in ways you can&#x2019;t really appreciate unless you&#x2019;re deep into the field&#x201d; (Paul Krugman, <em>New York Times</em>). In <em>Freefall</em>, Stiglitz traces the origins of the Great Recession, eschewing easy answers and demolishing the contention that America needs more billion-dollar bailouts and free passes to those &#x201c;too big to fail,&#x201d; while also outlining the alternatives and revealing that even now there are choices ahead that can make a difference. The system is broken, and we can only fix it by examining the underlying theories that have led us into this new &#x201c;bubble capitalism.&#x201d;<br><br> Ranging across a host of topics that bear on the crisis, Stiglitz argues convincingly for a restoration of the balance between government and markets. America as a nation faces huge challenges&#x2015;in health care, energy, the environment, education, and manufacturing&#x2015;and Stiglitz penetratingly addresses each in light of the newly emerging global economic order. An ongoing war of ideas over the most effective type of capitalist system, as well as a rebalancing of global economic power, is shaping that order. The battle may finally give the lie to theories of a &#x201c;rational&#x201d; market or to the view that America&#x2019;s global economic dominance is inevitable and unassailable.<br><br> For anyone watching with indignation while a reckless Wall Street destroyed homes, educations, and jobs; while the government took half-steps hoping for a &#x201c;just-enough&#x201d; recovery; and while bankers fell all over themselves claiming not to have seen what was coming, then sought government bailouts while resisting regulation that would make future crises less likely, <em>Freefall</em> offers a clear accounting of why so many Americans feel disillusioned today and how we can realize a prosperous economy and a moral society for the future.</p><p>Joseph E. Stiglitz is a Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist and the best- selling author of Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited: Anti- Globalization in the Age of Trump, The Price of Inequality, and Freefall. He teaches at Columbia University.The financial crisis has spawned a raft of audiobooks, but few are as lucid, constructive, and fair-minded as this one. A Nobel laureate and former chief economist at the World Bank, Stiglitz is a remarkably clear thinker and writer. While his liberal views won&#39;t be shared by every listener, he&#39;s equally critical of both the Obama and Bush administrations&#39; handling of the debacle. Dick Hill&#39;s narration is spot- on: perfectly paced, warm, and comfortable with the material. (Unlike many people, he pronounces &#34;Keynes&#34; correctly.) Hill mirrors the author&#39;s conversational style, his exasperation and humor, and even his moralizing tone as Stiglitz lays out his suggestions for how America must respond to the sins of the financial industry.

What would their message be? In November 2008, gifted clairvoyant Patricia Cori was in Jordan teaching a workshop when a life-changing event occurred. A community of Cetaceans&#x2014;&#x201c;a choir of whales and dolphins,&#x201d; as she describes it&#x2014;interrupted her talk with a frantic plea for help. Cori was suddenly witness to a devastating scene of suffering, a communal grieving of scores of whales and dolphins &#x201c;frenzied, lost, and dying.&#x201d; This was the first of several terrifying calls for help, all of which were immediately followed by mass suicide events as these majestic creatures collectively chose to leave us and our planet. <br> &nbsp;<br> These troubling incidents evolved into the stream of messages for humanity that Cori reveals in this extremely timely work. The whales and dolphins present their deep understanding of our urgent global situation, calling for the human race to restore balance to our ecosystems&#x2014;especially our dying oceans. For the first time, we read the communications of the Cetaceans and their story of devotion and celebration of life on the Great Planet Earth. We are also given a glimpse of their role in the unfolding of galactic events throughout our solar system, and the message is clear: We must wake up and realize that our continued abuse of the environment is altering the course of Gaia&#x2019;s progression to the next dimension. Without the whale and dolphin song&#x2014;without these musicians who hold the oceans in balance&#x2014;we risk our advancement through the ascension process for which our entire solar system is destined. <i>Before We Leave You</i> is a roadmap to that higher future and a pathway to global transformation. <br> &nbsp;<br> As a special gift, eighteen full-color, detachable Cetacean meditation cards, formed from wavelet graphs of whale and dolphin sounds and encoded with messages of love and visions for peace, are included.</p><p>Patricia Cori is a world-renowned author, adventurer, teacher/lecturer, and spiritual guide to the sacred sites of the Earth. A native of the San Francisco Bay Area, she has been immersed in the New Age Movement since its inception there in the early 1970s. She has utilized her clairvoyant abilities in healing and support work throughout her life, which has been dedicated in great part to the study of mysticism, philosophy, ancient civilizations, metaphysical healing, spirituality, and unexplained mysteries. Cori has been recognized and celebrated as a gifted shaman by indigenous spirit teachers of the Tibetan, Mayan, and Peruvian traditions and has guided people through sacred sites in Asia, Mexico, Egypt, Europe, and Peru, awakening them to Earth energies and the Secret Wisdom. <br> &nbsp;<br> A sought-after international figure who has made numerous radio appearances, Cori has been a keynote speaker at strategic conferences around the world and has recently been featured in the documentary films <i>The Circle Chasers 2006 </i>and<i> 2012&#x2014;We&#x2019;re Already In It! </i>She also appears in Terje Toftenes&#x2019;s new film,<i> The Concept. </i>Her growing list of best-selling books and her CD have enjoyed worldwide acclaim as wake-up call material for the expanding consciousness of humankind. <br> &nbsp;<br> Cori&#x2019;s devotion to the whales and dolphins of this earth have led her to spend numerous hours at sea, sailing close to the whales and swimming with dolphins in the wild. A tireless animalist, her goal is to help humanity wake up to the plight of our oceans and to discover how we can unite forces to save them and restore the balance.<br> &nbsp;<br> To find out more about her SoulQuest&#x2122; journeys, which include swimming with wild dolphins, check out her latest activities on her website: www.patriciacori.com.&#x201c;Patricia Cori has done a great service to us all, and I believe the majestic creatures of the sea as well, by turning her skill, passion, and intelligence toward understanding and protecting them, and simultaneously illuminating a path for human transformation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>New Consciousness Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Patricia Cori is the embodiment of the starseed project.

He lives in Los Angeles.Bond, James Bond. The signature music, the hot cars and hotter babes, the gadgets, and the exotic locales are among the intoxicating ingredients that comprise the ultimate fantasy character. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the film release of Dr. No. Five actors and 19 adventures later, our bond with Bond remains strong. And it's not just male Bonding: 007 is loved equally by women. This detailed, photo-rich (550 pix) tome chronicles the Bond story and beyond; the text not only offers background on the character and the productions but juxtaposes him within the world's political climate, which the films reflect. Although the plots are formulaic, the spy saves the world from a supercharged psychopath producer Cubby Broccoli worked with writers, directors, and actors to subtly refine the British agent throughout the decades while keeping the stories entertaining. Our man 007 has inspired imitators from Indiana Jones to Austin Powers, but there's no substitute for the original, and this title offers a detailed dossier of facts and photos that fans will find essential. Highly recommended. [This book and Nourmand's are being published to coincide with the release of the 20th Bond flick, Die Another Day, starring Pierce Brosnan, Halle Berry, and Dame Judi Dench.

Deotis Roberts (African American Religious Thought and Life)</h2><p>This is the first collection of the essays by J. Deotis Roberts, one of the most respected and influential figures in modern American theology. Roberts has spent much of his distinguished career doing theology in the service of the church. His desire has always been to influence church, academy, and world so that all may participate in the Kingdom of God. He has steered a middle way between the deadly metaphysical approach of some theology and the often unthoughtful pragmatism of Black religious studies that focuses only on social relevance.This book gathers Roberts&#39; most important essays, arranged to show the development of his thinking. They reveal his commitment to the church and to his theological model of liberation-reconciliation. Theology is free, Roberts writes, because it moves one toward a fuller realization of what God is calling one to do; Christian theology is reconciling because Christians are reconciled to God through Christ and are called to a ministry of reconciliation. J. Deotis Roberts has served as president of the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, and has taught at numerous institutions including Duke Divinity School and Howard Divinity School. His books include Quest for a Black Theology and Liberation and Reconciliation: A Black Theology. He currently lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.David Emmanuel Goatley is the Executive Secretary-Treasurer for the Lott-Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Committee in Washington, D.C.</p><p>David Emmanuel Goatley is the Executive Secretary-Treasurer for the Lott-Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Committee in Washington, D.C."In this splendid volume, the best essays of Roberts ae brought together for the first time.

The twelve-story skyscraper, the tallest at the time in the heart of St. Paul&#x2014;featuring the first glass elevator in the country&#x2014;merited a forty-page special edition of the <i>Pioneer Press</i>, whose editors modestly proclaimed it &#x201c;the greatest newspaper building mother earth carries.&#x201d; A year later, another architectural monument, the Endicott Complex&#x2014;which wraps around the Pioneer Building&#x2014;opened its doors. Designed by rising St. Paul architect Cass Gilbert, the Endicott included two office buildings linked by a one-story L-shaped shopping arcade crowned by a stained-glass ceiling.&nbsp;</p><p>Journalist and architectural historian Larry Millett tells the story of these two icons of downtown St. Paul from conception through numerous alterations to their present incarnation as vibrant cultural and living spaces in the city&#x2019;s center. He describes how the Pioneer came to be designed by noted Chicago architect Solon Beman, who in 1910 added four floors to create a sixteen-story light court that remains one of Minnesota&#x2019;s great architectural spaces. Millett also describes Gilbert&#x2019;s meticulous work in designing the Endicott complex, which was inspired by the Renaissance palaces of Florence. Gilbert would later go on to produce such masterpieces as the Minnesota State Capitol and the Woolworth Building in New York.&nbsp;</p><p>As entertaining as it is edifying, <i>Heart of St. Paul </i>combines architectural history with the rich human story behind two buildings that have played a prominent role in the life of the city for over a century. The book includes an introduction by Kristin Makholm, Director of the Minnesota Museum of American Art, which has found a new home in the buildings.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Larry Millett, a Minneapolis native, spent much of his career as a writer, reporter, and editor for the <i>St. Paul Pioneer Press,</i> where in 1985 he became the newspaper's first architecture critic, a post he held until his retirement in 2002. His many works include <i>Minnesota's Own: Preserving Our Grand Homes, Once There Were Castles: Lost Mansions and Estates of the Twin Cities, </i>and<i> Minnesota Modern: Architecture and Life at Midcentury,</i> also from Minnesota.</p><p>"If a building&#x2019;s famous for its height or style, someone may tell its tale.

No agenda or judgment. Loving someone purely for exactly who they are, with no conditions attached. Loving completely and consistently. Discernment may be present, but judgment is absent. Forgiveness of self and others and releasing all guilt as a prerequisite for unconditional love. Understanding that human suffering causes people to hurt others. Non-attachment to insult and injury, and compassion for the suffering of others. No bartering, controls of possessiveness. Love is the basis for what we all crave. The one who is loving is the blessed one, as they are feeling the love; they have the open heart. Loving with no inner criticism or judgment. Removing old pain from the heart to open it to loving. Hurtful people are too full of pain to feel unconditional love. A loving heart is like a magnet. Love begets love.<br> The dolphins are a wonderful example of unconditional love. They manifest the fruits of love, which are joy, playfulness, caring, and healing.<br> Unconditional love cannot occur with the presence of grudges or anger, whether they be conscious or unconscious. The key to forgiveness for self and others is being non-attached (detached) from the offense that we feel in our heart. The invalidation, abandonment, neglect, or deliberate harm they inflict comes out of their own suffering. Kowning this helps us not to take it personally. We all have certain wounds to our hearts, and as a results we shield and armor our hearts as a way of preventing injury.<br> The irony is that the heart that is "shut down" hurts us more than the protection we feel it gives us. It can make us lonely, isolated, and ill. We may be afraid to be vulnerable. Yet when we see that injury comes from another's ignorance, or the lack of love and awareness, it is easier not to take our wounds and injuries so personally. The person who hurt us the most may be the most frightened, hurt, and "closed down" person in our life.<br> At times, one person loves another, and the love is not returned in kind. The one who is loving is the blessed one, as they have the flow of love in their heart. Here, there is never any lack. The love and the sacred spirit of the divine are completely fulfilled in the Unity of the One.<br> Our guides, angels, and spiritual masters would never hurt us the way many people do. They do love us, unconditionally, with no judgment, but with full-time encouragement, patience, and warmth.<br> It is not easy to be open and vulnerable, but it is a wonderful adventure, as love begets love. A loving heart, unshielded, is like a magnet. Everyone wants to touch it and be touched by it. It is more precious than gold, to be in the presence of a radiant heart. One time I was in the holy presence of Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, a very enlightened Lama from Tibet with a huge heart. His radiance turned everything in the environment completely golden. He was conducting a Padmasambhava (the Lotus Born Gurn) initiation ceremony when this amazing apparition ocurred. Several people in attendance witnessed this glorious phenomenon. My husband Paul, whom I barely knew at the time, was also present and saw the same thing. We compared notes a year later and found out we'd both been blessed by the same golden vision and an infusion of spiritual love.<br> When a person comes to realize that people who inflict pain are people who are suffering very deeply, then it is easier for us to have compassion for them without internalizing their "stinging" actions or remarks. We learn not to be fooled by words or appearances. Importance, worldly wealth, status, or a golden tongue that professes to love can be very confusing, if it hides a wounded and wounding human being. So we learn to pay attention to actions more than words, as they do speak louder than words.<br> What is the feeling we get around a particular person? Sometimes our own awareness of this can alter the situation. We may be able to be vulnerable, enough, to beam love at that person. That love may alter the mean-spiritedness in them and allow a chink in their armor to fall away. A negative potential may be transformed into a positive reality through the healing light of love.<br> In the presence of love, most people feel safer to open up. Opening ourselves up is the road to love, and we often do it in stages. Unconditinal love discerns, but it does not cast judgments. It loves the other just as they are, wherever they are on their evolutionary path! Unconditional love doesn't want or need anything in return.<br> If the pain were to be extracted from all of our hearts, then people wouldn't do things to hurt each other or our Earth, anymore. It's the pain, in people's hearts, that makes them always want more. The pain causes the greed. If the pain were extracted, they would naturally be in harmony with all things. The pure, cleansed heart doesn't feel craving. It births wisdom, generosity, right action, patience, and harmony with all things. When each and every heart is "doctored" by a loving spirit, and the ancient pain is extracted, then we can live a life of unconditional love.</p><h2>Lawn Care: Astonishing Lawn Tips, Tricks, and Tonics Using Common Household Items!

This concentrate of &#34;grace and truth&#34; not only exposes these forces of death but with master skill imagines a way out of the morass.

Life: An Unauthorised Biography, was short-listed for the Rhone Poulenc prize and has been reprinted five times. In all he writes, Fortey displays extraordinary range, delight and descriptive gifts which make complicated scientific facts and concepts not only easy to understand but a delight to absorb. Trilobite! is an unashamedly trilobito-centric view of the world unravelling the history of the exotic, crustacean-like animals which dominated the seas for three hundred million years. These arthropods witnessed continents move, mountain chains elevated and eroded; they survived ice ages and volcanic eruptions, evolving and adapting exquisitely to their environment. They watched through their crystal eyes whilst life evolved. Their own evolution calibrated geological time itself. Structured like a detective story, this is a light, but highly informative account of the wonders of scientific discovery and an engaging, quirky and fascinating introduction to evolution.</p><p>With his new book <i>Trilobite! Eyewitness to Evolution</i>, Richard Fortey confirms his status as one of the best communicators of science around today. His hugely enjoyable previous book, <i>Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth</i>, was shortlisted for the 1998 Rhone-Poulenc science book prize, but <i>Trilobite!</i> is sure to receive even greater acclaim. Whereas <i>Life</i> took the reader on a whistle-stop tour of evolution from start to present--a huge undertaking that necessarily granted little space to each time period or taxonomic group--<i>Trilobite!</i> sees Fortey indulging in a whole book about his overriding paleontological passion, the long extinct and enigmatic creatures of the title. The result is a joy.<p> Trilobites--woodlicelike creatures that dominated the world's oceans long before the time of the dinosaurs--are, arguably, the most beautiful animals that have ever been chipped out of the fossil record. Fortey certainly seems to think so. His enthusiastic, almost loving explanations of the anatomy, ecology, and long evolutionary history of these fascinating vanished creatures carry the reader on an inspirational journey into the Earth's distant past. But the book is much more than a technical treatise on trilobites. We learn about Fortey himself, his formative years as an amateur then professional paleontologist, about his much-loved teachers and colleagues, and above all, about that strange but addictive pastime known as science. You may not find arthropods as charming as Fortey does, but you will not fail to be charmed by the author. A delightful read. <i>--Chris Lavers, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>"In Richard Fortey's capable hands the humble gray trilobite has been transformed into the E.T. of the Lower Palaeozoic - a lovable and highly instructive animal, amply deserving of the enthusiasm and affection with which it is memorialized in this remarkable and fascinating book." <br>-- Simon Winchester, author of <i>The Professor and the Madman</i><br><br>"This is the way science should be written: so engagingly that it makes you forget that you're actually learning something (actually, you're learning a lot), and carrying you swiftly from page to page so that before you know it, you've let the kettle boil over and you're at the end, where the 'suggested reading' list shows you that Fortey has read practically everything about trilobites so that he could condense it here for you, and make you feel that if it's not too late, you'd better call him up at the National History Museum and see if he needs an assistant in the trilobite section. If I had five thousand words I couldn't do <b>Trilobite!</b> justice. There's just no way to condense Fortey's glittering book so filled with insight, science, history, charm and wit. The book speaks brilliantly for itself. You must read it!"<br>-- Richard Ellis, author of <i>Deep Atlantic</i> and <i>Encyclopedia of the Sea</i></p><h2>Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Recounts the appearance of Our Lady of Guadalupe to a poor Indian farmer in Mexico in 1531.</p><p>Text: Spanish (translation)<br> Original Language: English</p><h2>One Dry Season: In the Footsteps of Mary Kingsley</h2><p>The author describes her experiences traveling in Gabon, and discusses the journeys of Mary Kingsley, a nineteenth century British explorer</p><p>In 1893 Mary Kingsley, then 30, ventured into what is now Gabon, West Africa, "a region notorious for its deadly climate and diseases, its alarming wildlife, and its cannibals." The British wayfarer was enthralled and penned Travels in West Africa . This classic led American doctoral student and pentathlete Alexander to embark on a similar odyssey, retracing Kingsley's steps. Armed with Kingsley's book and maps, her own background research, and a store of determination, the author trekked through bamboo forests and villages of mud huts, encountering incurious natives and serene missionaries. Juxtaposing the colorful details of her days with the writings of a vast cast of explorers from a century before, Alexander weaves a verbal tapestry that tells of her deepening affection for the Gabonese and growing admiration for the exploits of her 19th-century forebear. In superimposing motorboats, hydrofoils and other modernisms upon Kingsley's less "civilized" adventure, Alexander may come up short in her desire to "make contact with the past," but the record of her attempt will fascinate. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Kingsley's Travels in West Africa (1897) still makes wonderfully entertaining reading; she is a hard act to follow. Although travel to Africa has shed its exoticism, it still offers plenty of challenges, and Alexander found her share in equatorial Gabon, retracing the route up the Ogooue River taken by Kingsley nearly 100 years ago. Weaving a narrative pattern of "then and now," Alexander evokes images of chugging river steamers packed with passengers, roads of red dust, pirogues paddled against the current, and more. As she travels in the footsteps of others, she reflects on the different faces of interpretive writing, selective recollection, and the disparity between fact and fiction. But ultimately this is Alexander's own story of discovery and can be read and enjoyed as such. She avoids the patronizing, exaggerated tone of much contemporary travel writing about Africa; she is sympathetic and gently self-effacing. Recommended for libraries developing travel literature collections and for Africana collections.<br><i>-Janet L. Stanley, Smithsonian Inst.

This concise survey of her life and work places John&#x2014;often unfairly thought of as a recluse&#x2014;at the artistic heart of London and Paris. A seminal figure within these circles, her work is reappraised in that context and explored in terms of the alliances and differences John had with her contemporaries. Gwen John&#x2019;s representation of the female nude, her paintings of interiors, and the effect of her Catholic faith on her work are all discussed. The author also discusses the key relationship between John&#x2019;s position as a woman artist and her lifelong fascination with the portrayal of the female sitter.</p><p>&#34;From London in the 1890s to Paris during the early decades of the twentieth century, Gwen John&#39;s career spanned one of the most exciting periods in cultural history.

My first two books were memoirs about my experience battling addiction. For my first novel, I wanted to continue my exploration of psychological issues within the framework of a thriller. When two of my family&#x2019;s friends, both high-schoolers, were diagnosed with schizophrenia, I began researching the illness. Apparently this disease, which often lies dormant in teens, has been surfacing earlier and earlier in those with a genetic predisposition to the illness after these kids try smoking pot&#x2014;because our pot is so much stronger than it ever has been. I wanted to examine what happens to someone who experiences the symptoms of schizophrenia while still a teenager, someone trying to balance the hardships of mental illness at such a fragile time of life&#x2014;the everyday struggles of high school and relationships. Much of the novel is borrowed from my own experience, but it is also a departure. I hope it shows that mental illness is not a death sentence."1.<br><br>It&#x2019;s starting again.<br>There&#x2019;s a sound like an airplane descending loudly in my ear. I can&#x2019;t quite place it. The sweat is cold down my back. I feel my heart beat faster. My hands shake.<br>God, I can&#x2019;t take it.<br>I can&#x2019;t.<br>If it happens again&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>I hold my breath, waiting.<br>The sound fades in and out&#x2014;high-pitched, whining.<br>Preston and Jackie don&#x2019;t seem to notice.<br>They&#x2019;re on his bed together, which is really just like a futon on the floor, watching this old Billy Wilder movie.<br>Preston&#x2019;s arm is around her, and her arm is around him.<br>They are tangled together&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. intertwined.<br>Two separate people joined together into someone new and different, but still the same.<br>Not that I don&#x2019;t like Jackie. I mean, she&#x2019;s great. She&#x2019;s super great. And super nice.<br>They both are.<br>That&#x2019;s why they let me hang out with them.<br>Cause, believe me, I bring nothing to the table.<br>I&#x2019;m totally what you&#x2019;d call a charity case.<br>They let me hang out and watch movies and play video games until finally Preston&#x2019;ll give me a look like, Yo, me&#x2019;n my girl need to have some sex right now. And so then I&#x2019;ll leave.<br>And go home&#x2014;back to my family&#x2019;s little three-bedroom house on the avenues, the opposite of Preston&#x2019;s palatial mansion up here near the Palace of Legion of Honor. The house is like an old Gothic castle, paid for by the network TV show both his parents were on in the nineties.

He has basically his own floor in his parents&#x2019; house with a grow room set up in the closet.<br>I used to smoke, too, before it made me go crazy.<br>But that was more than two years ago.<br>I&#x2019;m sixteen now, and it&#x2019;s been over a year since my last episode.<br>Only there&#x2019;s this shrill, piercing scream coming in and out of auditory focus.<br>It&#x2019;s happening again.<br>Preston picks up his intricately blown glass bong from the carpeted floor in front of him and takes a big hit, exhaling away from me and Jackie&#x2014;being polite and all.<br>The thick gray smoke from his lungs smells sweet and pungent, and Preston says, &#x201c;Goddamn.&#x201d; And then he coughs.<br>Jackie looks over at me and rolls her eyes, but in a sweet way.<br>Her eyes are this intense green color, so if I look into them when I&#x2019;m talking, I get distracted and lose my train of thought. She has a long, angular nose and is tall and thin with dark black skin. She could be, like, a high-fashion model doing runway shows or whatever. She is lovely. If I weren&#x2019;t crazy maybe I could have a girl like her.<br>But it&#x2019;s not just that.<br>Preston is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br>I don&#x2019;t even know.<br>He is everything.<br>And he has everything.<br>If she&#x2019;s like a high-fashion model, then he&#x2019;s like some kinda rock star. He has long hair parted down the middle and a scruffy beard and square jaw. He&#x2019;s tall and naturally muscular, and it&#x2019;s just the way he carries himself, like he doesn&#x2019;t care at all.<br>He&#x2019;s been this way ever since I can remember&#x2014;calm and collected and unconcerned.<br>Preston and I met back when we were both ten years old going to this summer camp up in Watsonville right after his grandmother died. He used to stay up nights talking to me about her. Preston still makes, like, this big deal about it. I didn&#x2019;t think I did anything that special, but I guess it meant a lot to him.<br>We&#x2019;ve been best friends ever since&#x2014;even though I didn&#x2019;t start actually going to school with him until my mom got the job working in the library at Stanyan Hill my seventh grade year. It&#x2019;s a private school, so otherwise we&#x2019;d never have been able to afford it. My mom and dad kept talking about how much better an education I&#x2019;d get at Stanyan, but all I cared about was being able to hang out with Preston.<br>I watch him on the bed watching the movie. His arm is around Jackie, and he&#x2019;s resting his head absently on her shoulder. He&#x2019;s wearing a ripped hoodie over a vintage David Bowie T-shirt, sitting cross-legged, staring at the TV with a stoned innocence&#x2014;smiling.<br>Jackie absently strokes his hair and then kisses him on the forehead.<br>They are so effortless together.<br>And then there is that noise again&#x2014;buzzing, screaming&#x2014;darting in and out.<br>I look around.<br>I am sure somehow that this noise is not a real noise at all. This noise is my disease&#x2014;nothing but corroded synapses and misfiring chemical reactions.<br>Just when I&#x2019;d started to think things were getting back to normal again, the medication must&#x2019;ve stopped working.<br>The air is thick and greasy-feeling from the pot smoke and the incense and our collective breathing.<br>I fumble to get a cigarette out of my pack.<br>&#x201c;Miles, you all right?&#x201d; Jackie whispers&#x2014;staring like she wants to see inside of me to figure out the answer to her question.<br>I space out into her eyes for a second.<br>&#x201c;W&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what?

The shades are drawn and the windows are closed, and the only light is coming from the TV. I&#x2019;m sitting on the carpeted floor next to Preston&#x2019;s bed, wanting to scratch my back, my arms, everywhere, but not doing it &#x2019;cause Jackie is still trying to figure out if I&#x2019;m all right.<br>&#x201c;You wanna go smoke a cigarette?&#x201d; she asks me.<br>I pause, listening for that sound.<br>&#x201c;Miles?&#x201d;<br>And that&#x2019;s when I see it.<br>Right there, on Jackie&#x2019;s bare shoulder, a giant mosquito.

As a psychotherapist and researcher, Lawrence LeShan is more interested in the process and effects of meditation than the spiritual motivations. To LeShan, meditation means training the mind, and he likens it to physical exercise. Like a good trainer, he breaks down the different kinds of meditation into easy-to-learn steps and offers counsel about the best ways to go about it and the pitfalls you are likely to encounter. LeShan isn't pure vanilla, however. He wrote at a time (the early '70s) when meditation was still considered esoteric and strongly associated with the paranormal. Still, he keeps his feet on the ground and suggests that you do, too. Meditation, he says, helps get a new perspective on the world and to attain "an increased serenity and competence in being." If you are a beginning meditator, this perennial favorite is a good place to start. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>This simple, straightforward yet powerful guide has ready helped hundreds of thousands of people reap the greatest rewards of meditation. Lawrence LeShan's easy-to-follow and realistic approach allows you to bring meditation effortlessly into your life, no matter how busy you are, or how great the demands on your time are. His specific programs and exercises provide proven, practical tools for you to begin your journey and explore the many revealing paths of meditation <p>"If you're just considering it, <i>How To Meditate</i> is recommended equipment for the first steps." --Hank Basayne, Association of Humanistic Psychology.</p></p><h2>Braids 250 Patterns From Japan, Peru &amp; Beyond</h2><p>The author teaches the braiding techniques of the producers of the world&#39;s most beautiful patterns and most varied braiding structures: Japan (kumihimo) and Peru (sling braiding).

He seems to have taken a crack at just about every genre: mysteries, noirish thrillers, historicals, locked-room mysteries, adventure novels, spy capers, men&#39;s action, westerns, and, of course, his masterful, long-running Nameless private detective series, now entering its fourth decade, with no signs of creative flagging. He&#39;s also ghosted several Brett Halliday short stories as Michael Shayne for Mike Shayne&#39;s Mystery Magazine, and has managed to collaborate with such fellow writers as John Lutz, Barry Wahlberg, Collin Wilcox and Marcia Muller. Still, if he never ventured into fiction writing, his non-fiction work, as both writer and editor, would still earn him a place in the P.I. genre&#39;s Hall of Fame. Besides his two tributes to some of the very worst in crime fiction (what he calls alternative classics), Gun in Cheek and Son of Gun in Cheek, and one on western fiction (entitled Six Gun in Cheek, naturally), he&#39;s the co-author (with Marcia Muller) of 1001 Midnights. The Mystery Writers of America have nominated him for Edgar Awards several times and his work has been translated into numerous languages and he&#39;s published in almost thirty countries. He was the very first president of the Private Eye Writers of America, and he&#39;s received three Shamus Awards from them, as well as its Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. His passion for the old crime pulps is largely responsible for keeping them in the public&#39;s eye. He&#39;s amassed a huge collection of books and magazines and has always been an omnivorous reader; all of which made him a natural when it came to editing various anthologies. He admits it was a pleasure tracking down good stories to fit a particular anthology theme. But after editing 80 or so of them over a period of twenty-some years, he decided it was more than enough.Pronzini is a pro. --The New York Times<br><br>His novels are packed with adventure, fresh characterization, and minute-by-minute suspense. --Chicago Tribune<br><br>A skilled writer working at the top of his ability. --Denver Post</p><h2>Those Who Fall</h2><p>The author recalls his dangerous missions as a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber pilot during the Second World War and chronicles his prisoner-of-war experiences after his plane was shot down over Bulgaria</p><p><b>John Muirhead</b> was a lieutenant and WWII pilot shot down over Romania and taken prisoner in June 1944.

In <i>The Computer</i>, uber-technogeek Mark Frauenfelder traces the evolution of this vital machine from its earliest roots through its exciting application in code breaking during the Second World War, and from its initial use in the workplace and home to its current status as a ubiquitous&#x2014;and increasingly portable&#x2014;part of twenty-first century life. This highly illustrated social history of the computer examines its profound impact on every sphere of life.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Frauenfelder is a former editor of <i>Wired</i>, the cutting-edge and award-winning magazine launched in 1993 to cover the digital revolution, and the founding editor-in-chief of Wired Online.

Family history, not her own personal history, is Yourcenar's project; the former book dealt with her maternal forebears, this one her paternal line. To tell the story of her ancestors on her father's side, she looks far back--to prehistory--to describe the terrain from which her progenitors sprang, the Flanders region of northern France. Ancient times quickly give way to recorded history as Yourcenar then concentrates her focus on the social and historic contexts in which her family established itself and flourished. "Toward the beginning of the sixteenth century, a minor personage named Cleenewerck becomes visible, tiny from this distance like the figures that Bosch, Breughel, and Patinir inserted along the roads in the background of their landscape paintings to give a sense of scale." Middle-class privilege underscores tales of family lives over the centuries; then her narrative splendidly blossoms into two nearly full-length biographies as she presents her grandfather and her father. About those two men she has wonderful stories to tell, putting the reader in mind of the best French social fiction from the likes of Flaubert and Balzac; and the result is a very personable social and cultural history of nineteenth-century France. <i>Brad Hooper</i></p><h2>A Complicated Kindness</h2><p>&#34;Bold, tender and intelligent.&#34; PUBLISHERS&#39; WEEKLY &#34;A careful balance between hilarity and heartbreak that most readers will find unforgettable.&#34; BOOKLIST Nomi Nickel lives with her father, Ray, in East Village, a small Mennonite town in Manitoba.

The big problem facing managers and their organizations today is one of implementation--how to get things done in a timely and effective way. Stanford Business School Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer argues that problems of implementation are really issues of how to influence behavior, change the course of events, overcome resistance, and get people to do things they would not otherwise do. In a word, power.<br>Managing with Power provides an in-depth look at the role of power and influence in organizations. Power is often disparaged, yet Pfeffer shows convincingly that its effective use is an essential component of strong leadership. With vivid examples from Lyndon Johnson and Henry Kissinger to John Sculley and Henry Ford, he makes a compelling case for the necessity of power in mobilizing the political support and resources to get things done in any organization. And he provides a fascinating look at the personal attributes--such as flexibility, stamina, and a high tolerance for conflict--and the structural factors--such as control of resources, access to information, and formal authority--that can help managers advance organizational goals and achieve individual success.<br>Pfeffer begins his comprehensive evaluation of power by helping managers recognize situations that involve the use of power, and shows how to identify the principal actors and their likely points of view. He then looks at the different sources of power, and explains why some organizations and people use power more effectively than others. Next, he explores the specific strategies and tactics through which power and influence are used--how they help managers achieve tangible results. And finally, he considers issues of power dynamics: how power is lost, the role of power in the process of organizational change, and the positive and negative consequences of power for organizations.<br>Politics and influence, the mechanisms by which power is realized, are unavoidable components of any business--indeed, any organization. Pfeffer shows that by understanding where power comes from and how it can be used effectively, managers can help their organizations, and themselves, "achieve great things."</p><p>Jeffrey Pfeffer is Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Graduate School of Business, Stanford University.

He was immediately put into an isolation room at the local hospital in Brooklyn, New York. There was no cure and no vaccine for polio at that time, and city dwellers lived in fear of its spread. So for several weeks my father had no human contact, save for an occasional visit by a masked nurse. His mother came to see him every day, but that&#x2019;s all she could do &#x2013; wave to him and try to talk to him through the glass pane on the door. My father remembers calling out to her, begging her to come in. It must have broken her heart, and one day she ignored the rules and went in. She was caught and sternly reprimanded. My father recovered with no paralysis, but this image has always stayed with me: a small boy alone in a room, looking at his mother through the glass. </p><p>My father had the bad luck to be born at the confluence point of three big ideas. The first was germ theory, proposed in the 1840s by Ignaz Semmelweis and incorporated into hospitals and homes with gradually increasing ferocity over the next century. Pediatricians in the 1920s came to fear germs above all else as they began to collect statistics from orphanages and foundling homes. As far back as records went, they showed that most children dropped off at foundling homes died within one year. In 1915, a New York physician, Henry Chapin, reported to the American Pediatric Society that out of the ten foundling homes he had examined, in all but one of them <i>all</i> of the children had died before their second birthday. As pediatricians came to grips with the deadly effects of institutions on young children, they reacted in a logical way by launching a crusade against germs. It became a priority in orphanages and hospitals to isolate children as much as possible in clean cubicles, to prevent them from infecting each other. Beds were separated, dividers were placed between beds, nurses retreated behind masks and gloves, and mothers were scolded for violating quarantine. </p><p>The other two big ideas were psychoanalysis and behaviorism. These two theories agreed on very little, but they both agreed that the infant&#x2019;s attachment to its mother is based on milk. Freud thought that the infant&#x2019;s libido (desire for pleasure) is first satisfied by the breast, and therefore the infant develops its first attachment (psychological need) to the breast. Only gradually does the child generalize that desire to the woman who owns the breast. The behaviorists didn&#x2019;t care about libido, but they too saw the breast as the first reinforcer, the first reward (milk) for the first behavior (sucking). The very heart of behaviorism, if it had one, was conditioning &#x2013; the idea that learning occurs when rewards are <i>conditional</i> upon behaviors. So unconditional love -- holding, nuzzling, and cuddling children for no reason -- was seen as the surest way to make children lazy, spoiled, and weak. Freudians and behaviorists were united in their belief that highly affectionate mothering damages children, and that scientific principles could improve child rearing. Three years before my father entered the hospital, John Watson, the leading American behaviorist (in the years before B. F. Skinner), published the best seller <i>Psychological Care of Infant and Child</i>. Watson wrote of his dream that one day babies would be raised in baby farms, away from the corrupting influences of parents. But until that day arrived, parents were urged to use behaviorist techniques to rear strong children: don&#x2019;t pick them up when they cry, don&#x2019;t cuddle or coddle them, just dole out benefits and punishments for each good and bad action. </p><p>How could science have gotten it so wrong? How could doctors and psychologists not have seen that children need love as well as milk? This chapter is about that need &#x2013; the need for other people, for touch, and for close relationships. No man, woman, or child is an island. Scientists have come a long way since John Watson, and there is now a much more humane science of love. The story of this science begins with orphans and rhesus monkeys, and ends with a challenge to the dismal view of love held by many of the ancients, East and West. The heroes of this story are two psychologists who rejected the central tenets of their training: Harry Harlow and John Bowlby. These two men knew that something was missing in behaviorism and in psychoanalysis, respectively. Against great odds they changed their fields, they humanized the treatment of children, and they made it possible for science to greatly improve upon the wisdom of the ancients.</p></p><h2>Nachalo: When in Russia</h2><p>Introduction to Russian, Book 1.</p><p>Text: English, Russian</p><h2>The Art of Imperfection: Simple Ways to Make Peace with Yourself</h2><p>Forgive yourself: <br><br>Self-acceptance doesn't have to be hard work.

In the complexities and inconsistencies of immigration law, one can find a reason to deport almost any noncitizen at almost any time. In recent years, the system has been used with unprecedented vigor against millions of deportees.</p><p>We are a nation of immigrants--but which ones do we want, and what do we do with those that we don't? These questions have troubled American law and politics since colonial times. </p><p><i>Deportation Nation</i> is a chilling history of communal self-idealization and self-protection. The post-Revolutionary Alien and Sedition Laws, the Fugitive Slave laws, the Indian "removals," the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Palmer Raids, the internment of the Japanese Americans--all sought to remove those whose origins suggested they could never become "true" Americans. And for more than a century, millions of Mexicans have conveniently served as cheap labor, crossing a border that was not official until the early twentieth century and being sent back across it when they became a burden. </p><p>By illuminating the shadowy corners of American history, Daniel Kanstroom shows that deportation has long been a legal tool to control immigrants' lives and is used with increasing crudeness in a globalized but xenophobic world.</p></p><p>Daniel Kanstroom is Professor and Director of the Human Rights Program at Boston College Law School.Kanstroom's legal and social history of deportation reveals the development of a second system within our immigration politics, one of exclusion and expulsion, in which few if any Constitutional protections exist. Kanstroomshows the connections between the deportation of aliens and other removal practices in American history; the warning out of the poor, native-Americans removal, and fugitive slave law-- and makes a powerful and unsettling argument about the uses and abuses of today's immigration system. (Mae M. Ngai, Columbia University)<br><br>A brilliant study of a deportation system whose goals now include discretionary social control over millions of legal residents. Kanstroom masterfully marshals historical and contemporary evidence to show how our deportation system came about, and how it continues to subject legal residents to harsh treatment that would be unthinkable if applied to U.S. citizens. Both a devastating critique and a careful scholarly analysis, <i>Deportation Nation</i> should change the way we think about the legal treatment of noncitizens.

This accounts for both the strengths and the limitations of his admirably accessible, well-written, and usefully endnoted book. It will be valuable to anyone who wants to understand the precursors of today&#x2019;s broad deportation power, as well as its evolution into an instrument of wide-ranging governmental power over the conduct, status, and insecurities of immigrants hoping to sink roots in the USA.

Schuck <i>Journal of International Migration and Integration</i>)<br><br>From the deportation of self-proclaimed anarchist Emma Goldman in 1919, to Attorney General Mitchell Palmer's raids against alleged left-wing subversives in the 1920s, to the use of immigration laws against members of groups involved in organized crime and the Communist Party in later decades, and to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, <i>Deportation Nation</i> weaves a fascinating tale of the good, the bad, and the ugly sides of American immigration law. Kanstroom illustrates the government's selective use of immigration law, especially during periods of war and national emergencies...This is a timely book, and I highly recommend it.

Barkan <i>American Historical Review</i> 2008-04-01)<br><br>An ambitious reframing of the history of U.S. immigration law since colonial times. Making rich use of primary and secondary sources, this important book is both a work of legal history and an analysis of modern doctrine and policy. It examines the evolution of deportation as a system of "post-entry social control" that views noncitizens as "eternal guests" on "eternal probation." Kanstroom contrasts deportation as post-entry social control with a concept of deportation as extended border control that is limited to correcting mistakes in the admission process or enforcing the conditions of admission...<i>Deportation Nation</i> makes an invaluable contribution by bringing us to the brink of these questions about a fundamental aspect of justice in immigration, but leaves some of the answers for another day.

Although in his 90-first year and, naturally, showing signs of bodily weakness, he gave public talks and took part in discussions in different parts of India with all the vigour and the same passionate concern for the future of humanity as he has shown for the previous sixty years. He spoke of the facts of daily living, stressing always that in spite of the amazing technological achievements of modern times, man, psychologically, had remained the barbarian he was when he first appeared on the earth. Each of us, he maintained, was responsible for the brutality, butchery and divisiveness of the society in which we live because society was only a reflection of our inner selves, and nothing could save the world from the chaos it was in but a mutation in each human psyche. Says the mutation could be brought about, he claimed, but it must be now, what we are today we should still be tomorrow. Krishnamurti&#39;s message cannot be ignored. After reading him one can no longer shrug one&#39;s shoulder and say &#34;I know we are headed for disaster but what can I do about it?&#34; Krishnamurti was one of the world&#39;s great teachers. His vision and influence spanned a very long life, and his followers are found the world over. As in most books, this, this final message, is transmitted in the form of public conversations in question-and-answer sessions. --- from book&#39;s dustjacket</p><p></p><h2>52 New Testament Sermon Starters Book Two (Volume 2) (Pulpit Helps Outline Series)</h2><p>As a Bible teacher, preacher, evangelist, or pastor, finding time for proper sermon preparation in today's multi-tasked world becomes increasingly challenging. <i>52 Sermon Starters Volume One </i>can help!

The narrators of the ancient texts explain that civilization on their native planets had reached a point of such peacefulness that spiritual evolution had come to a standstill. They needed a "fire planet," such as Earth, to continue their unfoldment into the ultimate attainment--realization of the Self within. To persist in the lush atmosphere, genderless, organic bodies were formed through food-offering ceremonies. Later, through a slow process of mutation, the fleshy bodies we know today as human were established as vehicles for reincarnation. As the book progresses, a diminishing of the spiritual forces radiating from the Central Sun of the galaxy is described. As spiritual awareness wanes, the life force of man, kundalini, sleeps and instinctive desire manifests in abundance. These amazing chronicles of early man's life on Earth are told from within great, walled monasteries where narrators look back and forward at the same time, often reading from ancient texts, describing the daily life of those within and outside these sacred citadels. The theme throughout is to continue channeling the pristine spiritual vibration from the Central Sun as long as possible and to preserve the Lemurian culture, its wisdom and knowledge for generations far into the future. This, under the guidance of powerful gurus working closely with great Gods, was the spiritual mission of the dedicated monastics of these eras. Largely it was done by implanting sacred writings in the akasha by mystical means. <p>The Dravidian Shastras, which make up the second half of Lemurian Scrolls, will interest you from the point of view of how humans lived at the end of the Dvapara Yuga, their society, internal and external government, the culture of those early years on the Earth and how some of it carried forth to this very day. Our narrators explain that it was in the far distant past that the people who formed societies realized they needed group spiritual guidance. This group guidance is, to this day, recognized as a viable form of community and leadership. Examples that come to mind are the Dalai Lama's Tibet, where something like one-third of the social order is a monastic group, serving the religious and political needs of the two-thirds family group. Thus their society was transparently stable for hundreds and hundreds of years. This and other societies, such as villages in Europe, where monks and nuns were valued, were settled with a certain percent of monastics who served the religious needs of the other residents. The division of lay community and monastic community results in a wealthy, highly productive, harmonious society. We learn in the Dravidian Shastras just how this was accomplished in the long, long ago. It is prophesied that sustainable societies will once again emerge when mankind returns to the wise protocols of these earlier times, where spiritual men and women, spiritual principles and spiritual sharing guided both individual and society, where religious leaders were valued and sought after, for the populace knew that if they could be engaged in the social effort, they would lend it a light and wisdom that would not otherwise be available or important. These last sixteen chapters of Lemurian Scrolls explain the procedures of management, their gurus and their protocol. We can see its wisdom really worked, and our monastic order endeavored to emulate it as much as was possible in this modern, diverse age where divisions are normally accepted as signs of an advancing civilization and religion is considered an interference with scientific points of view. </p><p>Migrating to this planet in their subtle bodies, many of our forebearers traveled through the Sun. The beginnings of mankind's mission on this planet came in a far-away time, when the atmosphere was dense with waters and gases. Flowers and animals were larger and more exotic than today. At first, the transformation from etheric to physical form was difficult, but ceremonies evolved which, using the fragrances of fruits and flowers, brought devotionally to special pedestals, assisted in bringing through beings who absorbed these organic essences to materialize a denser, earthly, fibrous body. These beings loved the many jewels and golden ornaments that were crafted to bedeck and help support their flexible forms. Human life did not evolve from lesser earthly species. </p><p>Yugas before mankind arrived on Earth, celestial beings in wingless spacecraft spread seeds from other planets. Souls arriving in the last Sat Yuga eventually formed monasteries in which experiments were conducted into the nature of life, designing forms it should take on this planet. Their flexible bodies were light and easily flew in the dense air. Occasionally, one would be devoured by an animal, thus capturing this soul in the incarnation cycle of that species. Through the long mutative process of repeatedly reentering these instinctive bodies, they finally cultivated a body similar to, yet cruder than, the first fibrous bodies. To release a soul caught in an animal reincarnation cycle into human birth, ceremonial sacrifice was conducted, with the knowledge and silent consent of the animal. </p><p>Fruits, honey, milk, nuts and seeds formed the basis of the pure and simple Lemurian diet. A most delectable dish called Lemurian prasadam was prepared daily in large vats, made of various combinations of fresh milk products such as yogurt, along with several fresh fruits, dates, nuts, seeds and honey from the bees, all gathered from the forests and fields in large baskets--mixed together and eaten from natural goards. It was a sattvic and invigorating meal, especially for those who deeply meditated. This was all they consumed day after day. To help keep the body flexible and easy to live in, exercises were performed at dawn, noon and sunset. Working with mental powers, they provided equilibrium for the planet, and nearly everything could be done with the mind, even moving and lifting things.</p></p><p>Lemuria is one of our most prized and puzzling mysteries--a memory of Earth's brightest spiritual civilization and epoch burrowed in our collective subconscious. Lemurian Scrolls presents a remarkably detailed, clairvoyant reading of how beings from ancient planets in the Pleiades star cluster traveled by mind-of-light-powers to colonize Earth four million years ago. Earth was a young, atmospherically-rich planet bathed in far stronger kundalini forces than our present era, and therefore was a spiritually challenging world for the new inhabitants seeking the experience necessary to attain the final realization of the universal Self. This non-fictional saga unfolds how these beings&#x2014;the Lemurians&#x2014;manifested sexless, semi-immortal bodies, kept contact with their Pleiadean home worlds, how they psychically evolved our present human body, the spiritual societies and civilizations they developed, diet and cultural practices of the Lemurians, how reincarnation for humans began, the nature of yuga time spans in relation to cultural/spiritual developments, what happened after Lemuria and more. Includes the most extensive discussion of kundalini in relation to individuals, earth and the galaxy available. Appendix includes synopses of origin-of-humankind teachings from religions and indigenous faiths. Illustrated with original drawings.Certain parts of the Lemurian Scrolls were easy to read, as a translation did not have to occur through the process of the universal language that happens within the akasha area of the mind when languages foreign to an individual are encountered. In the Antarloka, as well as the Sivaloka, each one hears another speak in the language he is accustomed to, due to the immediate process of translation that occurs. This is called the universal language. The Lemurian script and Dravidian script seemed to leave the page, travel toward me through the akashic ether, enlarging themselves as they did, and I would speak out the meaning. More than often, after speaking out the meaning, print would leave the page, and the actual scene, in vivid picture form, would appear in place of it, depicting what had been described. Some of these books stood three feet tall and when opened spanned about a four-or-five-foot area. These were the Lemurian collection, written during the Treta Yuga. They all had heavy covers and were placed into the akasha library through certain prescribed methods used in that day. Some of the covers were decorated in gold, with a light-green, suede-leathery-type material covering them; others were brown and still others red and covered with jewels.</p><h2>Conquest: The English Kingdom of France, 1417&#x2013;1450</h2><p><p>For thirty dramatic years, England ruled a great swath of France at the point of the sword&#x2014;an all-but-forgotten episode in the Hundred Years&#x2019; War that Juliet Barker brings to vivid life in <i>Conquest.</i> </p><p> </p><p> Following Agincourt, Henry V&#x2019;s second invasion of France in 1417 launched a campaign that would place the crown of France on an English head. Buoyed by conquest, the English army seemed invincible. By the time of Henry&#x2019;s premature death in 1422, nearly all of northern France lay in his hands and the Valois heir to the throne had been disinherited. Only the appearance of a visionary peasant girl who claimed divine guidance, Joan of Arc, was able to halt the English advance, but not for long. Just six months after her death, Henry&#x2019;s young son was crowned in Paris as the first&#x2014;and last&#x2014;English king of France. </p><p> </p><p> Henry VI&#x2019;s kingdom endured for twenty years, but when he came of age he was not the leader his father had been. The dauphin whom Joan had crowned Charles VII would finally drive the English out of France. Barker recounts these stirring events&#x2014;the epic battles and sieges, plots and betrayals&#x2014;through a kaleidoscope of characters from John Talbot, the &#x201c;English Achilles,&#x201d; and John, duke of Bedford, regent of France, to brutal mercenaries, opportunistic freebooters, resourceful spies, and lovers torn apart by the conflict.</p></p><p>Juliet Barker is one of Britain's most distinguished literary biographers and medievalists and author of <i>Agincourt: Henry V and the Battle That Made England.</i>Juliet Barker's new book is a magnificently readable account of the last four decades of [the Hundred Years' War] ...

There is a steady succession of treaties, marriages, murders, massacres, famines, sieges, battles and skirmishes, but Barker has an eye for the kind of detail that can illuminate the mindset of the long-dead. (Stephen Brumwell <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2012-03-07)<br><br>[A] lucid guide to this very complicated period...Barker's narrative combines high drama and low humor. It could be argued that both the origin and end of the English Kingdom of France was a dynastic comedy of errors...Barker is both learned and lucid in bringing alive the characters, the struggle and the ultimate futility of it all. (Aram Bakshian, Jr. <i>Washington Times</i> 2012-06-08)<br><br>Barker weaves together the threads of an extremely complicated story, involving infighting among English notables for positions in France, the major roles of Burgundians (creating essentially a French civil war) and Scots in the fighting, and the double-dealing of many French leaders. The continuous fighting caused enormous destruction and population loss, especially in Normandy, and very few participants gained honor in the struggle, although Charles VII comes across here as a more effective leader than how he is usually portrayed. Highly detailed with valuable information on the huge human and financial resources England invested during the war's final decades, the book is nonetheless engaging and well written. (F. J.

Unfortunately, nobody had told the Dowayo. His compulsive, witty account of first fieldwork offers a wonderfully inspiring introduction to the real life of a cultural anthropologist doing research in a Third World area. Both touching and hilarious, Barley's unconventional story--in which he survived boredom, hostility, disaster, and illness--addresses many critical issues in anthropology and in fieldwork.<p> Also by Nigel Barley and available from Waveland Press: <i>Grave Matters: Encounters with Death around the World</i> (ISBN 978-1577664310).

So off I went every day, armed with my tobacco and notebooks and paced out the fields, calculated the yields, counted the goats in a flurry of irrelevant activity. This at least had the virtue of making my weird and inexplicable ways familiar to the Dowayos and I began to know them by name.&#34; (from Chapter 6)"I absolutely love this book and am using it this semester. The text is extremely readable and provides students with real insight into how fieldwork can go right even in the face of adversity." --Yvonne Downes, Hilbert College<br><br>"I have decided to use it in my Introduction to Cultural Anthropology course.

The poems themselves are regarded as unimportant - outpourings of the moment, discarded once they&#39;ve been used. Since the Eskimo saw no need to save poems, it is fortunate that anthropologists and explorers who visited the Arctic in the last hundred years wrote many of them down, From this material Richard Lewis has selected 90 representative poems: magical chants, lullabies, songs to bring luck while hunting, songs to taunt enemies. Anthropologist Edmund Carpenter&#39;s fascinating introduction describes the people, their beliefs, and their ways of forming poetry.

Yet the peoples' perception that "things are worse than before" can topple revolutionary governments, as shown by the recent defeat of the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua and the governments of Eastern Europe. Providing the kind of prosaic, revealing details that more formal histories have excluded, My Car in Managua offers an objective, often humorous description of the great difficulties and occasional pleasures of life in Nicaragua during the Sandinista revolution.</p> <p>During a year's work (1985-1986) at the Instituto Centroamericano de Administraci�n de Empresas (INCAE), Forrest Colburn purchased a dilapidated car&#x2014;and with it an introduction to everyday life in Nicaragua. His discoveries of the length of time required to register the car (approximately six weeks), the impossibility of finding spare parts (except when U.S. dollars were applied to the search), and the fact that "anyone getting into a car in Managua can be charged a small fee [for car watching] by anyone else" all suggest the difficulties most Nicaraguans faced living in a devastated economy.</p> <p>Drawing on experiences from visits throughout the revolutionary period (1979-1989), Colburn also sheds light on how the Revolution affected social customs and language, gender roles and family relationships, equality and authority, the availability of goods and services, the status of ethnic minorities, and governmental and other institutions. Illustrations by Nicaragua's celebrated political cartoonist R�ger S�nchez Flores enliven the lucid text.</p></p><p>Forrest Colburn teaches politics at Princeton University.</p><h2>Midnight Assassin: A Murder in America&#39;s Heartland</h2><p>In 1900, Margaret Hossack, the wife of a prominent Iowa farmer, was arrested for bludgeoning her husband to death with an ax while their children slept upstairs. The community was outraged: How could a woman commit such an act of violence? Firsthand accounts describe the victim, John Hossack, as a cruel and unstable man. Perhaps Margaret Hossack was acting out of fear. Or perhaps the story she told was true&#x2014;that an intruder broke into the house, killed her husband while she slept soundly beside him, and was still on the loose. Newspapers across the country carried the story, and community sentiment was divided over her guilt. At trial, Margaret was convicted of murder, but later was released on appeal. Ultimately, neither her innocence nor her guilt was ever proved. <br><br> Patricia Bryan and Thomas Wolf examine the harsh realities of farm life at the turn of the century and look at the plight of women&#x2014;legally, socially, and politically&#x2014;during that period. What also emerges is the story of early feminist Susan Glaspell, who covered the Hossack case as a young reporter and later used it as the basis for her acclaimed work &#x201c; A Jury of Her Peers.&#x201d; <br><br><i>Midnight Assassin</i> expertly renders the American character and experience: our obsession with crime, how justice is achieved, and the powerful influence of the media.</p><p>On a moonlit night in December 1900, a prosperous Iowa farmer was murdered in his bed&#x2014;killed by two blows of an ax to his head. Four days later, the victim's wife, Margaret Hossack, was arrested and charged with the crime.<br> <br> The vicious assault stunned and divided the close-knit rural community. The accused woman claimed to be innocent, and some in the community supported her, refusing to believe that a woman could be capable of such a violent act. Others thought she was guilty, because she didn't cry or show emotion&#x2014;her overall lack of femininity suggested to many that she was capable of violent murder. And when neighbors spoke of abuse within the Hossack home, the prosecutors had what they needed: evidence that Margaret Hossack had a motive to kill her husband.<br> <br> <i>Midnight Assassin</i> takes us back in time&#x2014;to the murder, the investigation, and the trials of Margaret Hossack. The book introduces us to Susan Glaspell, a young journalist who reported the story for the <i>Des Moines Daily News</i> and, fifteen years later, transformed the events into the acclaimed short story, "A Jury of Her Peers." <br> <br> Patricia L. Bryan and Thomas Wolf researched the Hossack case for almost a decade, combing through the legal record, newspaper accounts, government documents, and unpublished memoirs. The result is a vivid portrait of life in rural America at the turn of the century and a chilling step-by-step account of the crime and its aftermath.<br> <br> <i>Midnight Assassin</i> is about the ways that prejudice and fear can influence justice and how people's preconceptions inform the legal process. It is about a woman tried for a crime but punished for her character.Patricia Bryan is a professor of law at the University of North Carolina.

Apart from their pointed ears, they look just like ordinary children. They live by their wits and a few Borrible laws-the chief one being, Don't Get Caught! The Borribles are outcasts-but they wouldn't have it any other way....<br>One night, the Borribles of Battersea discover a Rumble-one of the giant, rat-shaped creatures who are their ancient enemy-in their territory. Fearing an invasion, an elite group of Borrible fighters set out on what will become known in legend as The Great Rumble Hunt. So begins the first of the three epic adventures in Michael de Larrabeiti's classic trilogy, where excitement, violence, low cunning, greed, generosity, treachery, and bravery exist side by side.</p></p><p><p>Michael de Larrabeiti was brought up in Battersea. He is the author of two more books about the Borribles--<i>The Borribles Go For Broke</i> and <i>The Borribles: Across the Dark Metropolis</i>--as well as many other books. He has three grown-up daughters and lives with his wife in Oxfordshire.</p>BORRIBLES: ACROSS THE DARK METROPOLIS<br>1Sergeant Hanks of the Metropolitan Police and second in command of the Special Borrible Group sat on a chair outside the office of the District Assistant Commissioner and picked his nose in a state of unalloyed rapture. He had excavated very successfully for ten minutes in the left nostril and he was now delving in the right one. As the curved nail of his index finger dug into something soft and spongy his eyes closed with the joy of an exquisite physical pleasure, and when, at last, the moist and luxuriant bogey was pulled reluctantly away from its tenacious root and coaxed out into the light, Hanks just half opened a single eye and examined his trophy with a close and professional interest.'Hmm,' he said, 'first class that one, looks like a well-fed whelk.' And he stuck it under his chair and crossed his fat ankles in utter contentment. This was the life.Inside the office, Sergeant Hanks's superior, Inspector Sussworth, was not enjoying himself. Quite the contrary. He was standing to attention before a large leather-topped desk, his lips tightly clenched and his postage stamp of a moustache humming with indignation. Sussworth was in serious trouble and the District Assistant Commissioner was making sure that he knew it.'It's not good enough,' said the DAC, 'just not good enough. Two months ago I was assured that you had these Borribles all cooped up in Wandsworth. No way out, eh? That's what you said. And the horse, eh? Where are they now?'Inspector Sussworth opened his mouth to answer but shut it again immediately as the DAC held up his hand for silence.'Escaped, that's what, escaped.' The DAC's voice was pointed and half-transparent, like shards of bone china. He was elegantly turned out in a well-cut suit of dark grey and a shirt that was as crisp as newly fallen snow. His tie indicated, discreetly, that he had once been connected with an exclusive regiment, and his shoes shone so brilliantly that it was impossible to tell what colour they were.He examined one of those shoes for a second, on the end of a stiffly straight leg, and, satisfied with the sheen, he got to his feet, rising easily from his swivel chair. 'You see, Sussworth,' he continued, 'I gave you the command of the finest body of men to be found in any police force in the world, in the world mark you, and all you have managed to achieve is a spectacular failure.' The DAC snorted and began to pace the olive-green carpet that covered the wide expanses of his office floor.Sussworth gazed out of the window and down on to the jumbled skyline of London. It was wet out there, and cold. It had stopped raining but only so that it could start again presently. Only midway through the afternoon and the office lights were already gleaming across the dark from a thousand windows in a hundred skyscrapers.Sussworth sighed. London was his patch, all of it. He sighed again. It was the Borribles' patch too; the whole town was lousy with them. At that very moment Borribles were out on the streets stealing stuff like nobody's business; and if they weren't stealing they were idling and lounging about in empty houses; activities that Sussworth had sworn to stop.The DAC returned from his stroll and stood once again behind the desk, facing the inspector. He was tall and languid, the DAC, and his face was well bred and haughty and pink, like a judge's in a wig. He sighed too, deeply, as if exhausted by being alive; the road of his life had been strewn with fools.'All you have done, Sussworth,' he said, 'is to smash up some Transit vans on Eel Brook Common, get some twenty of your men injured and invalided out of the force, and then allowed these Borrible ringleaders to escape.' He raised his hand as Sussworth took a breath. '"Safe and sound, sir," you said. "Safe and sound in Wandsworth. They can't get away." Can't get away, eh? Not only did they get away but they got away with a horse. Dash it all man, a horse! It escapedfrom your own police station. Why, you were the laughin' stock of everyone'.Sussworth fidgeted on his feet but made no attempt to answer.'I admit,' went on the DAC, setting off on another stroll, 'that you've captured a few Borribles and clipped their ears, but you couldn't call them important, they aren't the chaps we want. Concentrate on the ringleaders.'Sussworth twitched his neck. He could not bear to stand still for so long. He needed to be on the go; stamping, turning, marching.'Don't you realize, Sussworth, that the more you let these Borribles get away with things the more they undermine society? We can't allow it. It is our responsibility to see that society stays where it is. We can't have Borribles doin' what they like, livin' as they like, goin' where they like. You must find this gang of Borribles and eliminate them. Above all you must find their horse, which seems to act as some kind of mascot, and you will turn it into catsmeat. If you fail, Sussworth, then I'm afraid I shall be obliged to hand your job over to Chief Superintendent Birdlime of C Division. He's an up and comin' chap, you know, and as keen as mustard.'Sussworth was allowed to speak at last: 'I've tried everything sir, but London's such a huge place. It is not plain sailing to apprehend these malcontents.'The DAC gave Sussworth a pitying smile from the fireplace, where he had propped himself at an angle against the wall. 'My dear Sussworth,' he said, 'it is your duty to apprehend them, and once apprehended to make sure they have no chance to get away again. If the old methods are not successful you must try new methods; you must be crafty, sly and even evil if necessary. Do you think that Caesar and Alexander got to the top by playing the white man? Think, Sussworth, think. You must infiltrate Borrible culture; you need a fifth column, spies, traitors. Do anythin' to achieve your end ... but don't tell me about it. Inform me of your success, but not how you do it.'Sussworth's moustache began to twitch in anger but he restrained himself. He nodded vigorously. 'Yes sir, infiltrate, bribe, corrupt. Yes sir.'The DAC ambled back to his seat and lowered his body into it. He placed his elbows on the desk and laced the fingers of his right handwith those of his left. 'Don't you realize, Sussworth, that life is a game of snakes and ladders? If we are successful, you and I, there is promotion in this. We would both be up the ladder. I could be Commissioner this time next year and you ... Well, for a man of your energy and intelligence, the sky's the limit, the sky.'The DAC smiled wisely and rotated his chair at a leisurely speed so that he could look out through the plate glass of his window. The storm clouds, heavy with rain, had lowered themselves down to a dim horizon, and the endless confusion of London roofs and buildings was fading into one dull tone of dark blue.The DAC stretched his arms. 'Winter's comin',' he said as if the statement were philosophy, 'and that can only help. Not so many people on the streets; the Borribles will be easier to spot. It's up to you, Sussworth, complete annihilation of this criminal band of Borribles, nothing else will satisfy me. Don't let me hear anythin' but good news, do you follow? Eh? Or it will be bad news for you. Birdlime is waitin', Birdlime is waitin'.''Yes sir,' said Sussworth. 'Of course, sir.' He stood hesitant, not knowing if he had been dismissed or not. He waited for the DAC to swivel round from the window, but the DAC remained gazing into the darkening panorama spread out below him, watching the lights shine ever brighter.Sussworth decided to leave. His moustache twitched and twirled, and he saluted and turned in one nervous movement and marched quickly over the carpet towards the polished oak door of the office. He opened it and passed through, closing it reverentially behind him, the muscles of his face rigid with hate.&nbsp;<br>Inspector Sussworth seized his hands behind his back and strutted between the door and the window of his office like Admiral Nelson on his quarterdeck. Sergeant Hanks had hooked his large and wobbly buttocks on the desk, folded his arms over his egg-stained tunic and was cocking his fleshy ears to scoop up every word his superior was about to utter. Both men were in the SBG headquarters, Micklethwaite. Road, Fulham.'That was a high-powered conference at Scotland Yard,' Sussworth said, 'very high-powered.'Hanks loosened his fat lips and smiled blankly. At the same time hepushed his hand into a coat pocket and drew out a bar of chocolate. 'I'm glad to hear it, sir,' he said. 'Care for some fruit and nut?'Sussworth waved his hand impatiently and spun on his heel through a hundred and eighty degrees, about ninety degrees more than he had intended, and was somewhat surprised to find himself facing the window overlooking the street. 'There is more to life than fruit and nut,' he said, his voice sombre. 'We have problems, Hanks, vast problems.'Hanks looked at the inspector's back and shoved half the chocolate into his mouth, salivating so freely that the moisture dribbled down his chin. It was a brown colour flecked with chewed raisins.'The DAC and I,' continued the inspector, 'have decided that the situation, <i>re</i> the Borribles, is critical and chronic. A new initiative must be implemented. We are going to concentrate our efforts on the main criminal gang, the gang from Eel Brook Common. Those ragamuffins must be apprehended and their ears clipped without delay. Their hideouts must be demolished. They've got to be made to behave like everyone else, earn money like everyone else and grow up like everyone else. Society is our responsibility, Hanks.''It is indeed, sir,' agreed Hanks, masticating slowly, lips smacking.'There is a slackness in the ranks, Hanks. Both the DAC and I had a long discussion about this. The Borribles are undermining the pillars of society and when that happens those pillars topple. Freedom leads to anarchy. They must conform to law and order.''They must conform indeed,' said Hanks. He lifted his weight from the desk and waded to a food cabinet which stood just outside the door of the office. He opened this cupboard and, taking out a roll, he cut it in half, buttered it and then spread it with thick honey.'I likes this stuff,' he announced, and squeezed the roll between his teeth so that the honey oozed over his chin and on to his tunic.Sussworth ignored the remark and performed a reverse turn quickstep across the room and around the desk. He sat down and then got up again immediately as if he had sat in something wet and nasty. His expression hardened and his moustache twitched from side to side, matching the movements of his feet.'The men will have to be reprimanded,' he said, 'and then retrained. We have to get those Borribles and above all that horse. This is a crisis. We must think of something new: bribery, corruption.''That's not new, sir.''There's promotion in the offing, Hanks. You will become an inspector; I shall rise to DAC and the DAC will get a knighthood. Imagine the glory, Hanks. Knighthoods. Sir Sergeant Hanks. Lord Sussworth of Fulham. The mind boggles.''Boggles,' said Hanks.Sussworth raised a hand to his forehead and fell into his chair. 'This is our last chance. If we fail we will be demoted to the ranks and Birdlime will be in. We have to think of some means of penetrating the Borrible infrastructure.''Super-narks!''Exactly.''What we need is someone on the inside,' said Hanks. 'That's what we need.'Sussworth got out of his chair again, stamped both feet at once and strode to the window. His hands, still behind his back, made a determined attempt to strangle one another. 'Precisely,' he said, and emotion steamed out of his ears like there were two kettles boiling in his head.Hanks stood in the middle of the room, lifted a finger to his nose and screwed it into a nostril just as far as it would go, about the second knuckle. 'What we want,' he said, 'is a regiment of bloody dwarfs.'Silence slid down over the room like a tipper-truck load of wet cement. Sussworth suddenly crouched and turned from the window very slowly, inch by inch, pointing a rigid finger at his subordinate who continued to stand, all innocent, grappling with a bogey. Sussworth laughed the laugh of contentment.'Ha! Hanks, ha! I have just had the most brilliant idea.' Sussworth advanced towards his sergeant, still crouching and still pointing. 'Did you know I was top of my year at Hendon Police College? My brain is a computer that never stops computing, taking in information and storing it until the day when, compressed by the white heat of necessity ... You Reeker! Out comes the desired answer. In other words, what we need is a regiment of dwarfs.'A look of puzzlement wandered over Hanks's face and he removed the finger from his nose without even looking at it. 'I just said that,' he said. He took a teapot from the cupboard and ladled some tea into it. 'I could have sworn I said that.'Sussworth straightened his back and dropped his pointing arm. He jigged around to the rear of the desk and sat down. 'Don't be foolish, Hanks,' he said. 'I do not want to see you change the habits of a lifetime, habits that have stood you in good stead. Your job is not inception but implementation.''Oh,' said Hanks, and he flicked on the switch that controlled the electric kettle.'That's why I am in my position and you are in yours, Sergeant,' said Sussworth as prim as a parson. 'Now listen to me. We shall place advertisements, discreetly, in the newspapers, especially the trade papers--<i>The Stage, The Circus and Sideshow, Fun-Fair Weekly</i>--all of them, offering employment to young adult midgets and dwarfs. Got that, Hanks? We only want the young-looking ones.'Hanks unplugged the boiling kettle and poured its contents into the teapot.'We want midgets from all walks of life,' said Sussworth. 'We'll train them and get them ready; we'll tell them all about Borrible customs, everything. They'll steal and live in broken houses like Borribles and they'll know all the proverbs, just like Borribles. They will infiltrate, insinuate and penetrate.'Hanks sucked at his tea and made a noise like water going down a drain in the middle of a storm. 'Dwarfs don't have pointed ears,' he observed. 'Borribles do.' The sergeant smiled like a quicksand smiling at the sound of approaching footsteps; there was no answer to that.Sussworth banged the desk and stamped the floor. 'You can't beat me,' he said. 'Honours at Hendon, that's what I got. We'll have special plastic ears fabricated, pointed, and we'll clip them on.'Hanks's vast stomach rolled under his stained tunic like water in a balloon. 'I don't think that will work, sir. If a Borrible gets suspicious of one of your spies and pulls at his ears, why, then the lugholes would come off and bye-bye dwarfs. The Borribles would have their guts for garters.' He handed the inspector a mugful of tea, hot, black and strong.Sussworth sipped. 'Difficulties,' he said, 'only exist to be overcome by minds like mine. If clips won't achieve our purpose then we shall affix the ears with superglue; nothing gets that off, I can assure you, however a Borrible might pull at it.''Superglue,' said Hanks. 'But them dwarfs'd never get the ears unstuck again. I can't see them standing for that ... I...</p><h2>Think About These Things</h2><p><p>"The heavens declare the glory of God . . ."<br> Psalm 19:1a</p> <p>Towering mountains, crashing waves, and delicate flowers-all shout the glory of the living God.

His previous two books, <i>Midlands</i> (2002) and <i>The Number</i> (2004) both won South Africa's premier nonfiction literary award, the <i>Sunday Times</i> Alan Paton Prize.

It was a dramatic declaration of intent, unprecedented in sub-Saharan Africa. By the time the drugs had hit the shelves and health personnel were ready to administer treatment, just about every soul in Botswana knew of it. </p><p> And yet, on the last day of 2003, more than two years after the launch of the program, only about fifteen thousand people had come forward for treatment. The rest -- over eighty-five thousand people -- had stayed at home. The majority would now be dead. </p><p> Why did they not go to get the drugs? </p><p> "Stigma," is Cameron's answer. "People are too scared -- too ashamed -- to come forward and claim what their government is now affording them:...the right to stay alive...In some horrifically constrained sense, they are 'choosing' to die, rather than face the stigma of AIDS and find treatment." </p><p> Does this foreshadow an entire region's response to AIDS? When the history of this great epidemic is written, will it be said that an untold number of people died, not because the plague was unstoppable, but because they were mortally ashamed? Will it be said that several successive generations of southern Africans were decimated by a sense of disgrace? </p><p> About 2.1 million people died of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in 2006. Another 25 million are living with HIV. In South Africa, where I was born and bred, nearly 6 million in a population of 46 million are HIV-positive: more than one in eight people. Some eight hundred South Africans die of AIDS on an average day. And the epidemic is spreading at a rate of more than a thousand new infections a day in South Africa. That death could keep accumulating on this scale despite the presence of lifesaving medicines is chilling beyond description. </p><p> A certain intellectual temperament greets such spectacles with excited fascination. The moral of Cameron's story, it may be tempting to conclude, is that human lives are not sunny and progressive projects, but the sites of blunt, blind tragedy. Not just the world, but even our own natures are indifferent to our programs of betterment. </p><p> I am not one of those fascinated souls. When I read a story like Cameron's, my gut response is that something is wrong, something that might be fixed. This is not to say I subscribe to the proposition that, at core, our natures are healing and life-giving. There is a surfeit of shame and envy and destruction within us, quite enough to go around. But it seems to me that what becomes of this darkness is not a question of fate but of politics. When people die en masse within walking distance of treatment, my inclination is to believe that there must be a mistake somewhere, a miscalibration between institutions and people. This book is a quest to discover whether I am right. </p><p> When I finished reading Cameron's book I began to look for the most successful antiretroviral treatment program in South Africa. I wanted to find a place where poor villagers lived within walking distance of well- administered drugs, and where nobody need die for lack of medical care. I wanted to go there and find people who were staying at home and dying, and I wanted to know why they were doing so. </p><p> The closest thing I found to what I was looking for was the rural district of Lusikisiki in Eastern Cape province. It is not quite true that everybody there lives within walking distance of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment, or that nobody need die for lack of medical care. It is a chronically poor place, where people have been dying for want of decent care since long before the HIV virus. But extraordinary work was being done there. The international nongovernmental organization M�decins Sans Fronti�res (MSF, and called in English, Doctors Without Borders), in partnership with the Eastern Cape Department of Health, was using the district's rickety and neglected primary health-care clinics to administer antiretroviral treatment. When MSF arrived in 2002, nearly one in three pregnant women was testing HIV-positive. At least one person a day was dying of AIDS at the hospital on the outskirts of town. Most of those infected with the virus were still asymptomatic; in the absence of a medical intervention, an avalanche of death was to come. </p><p> MSF was putting out very good news indeed. Staffed by a cohort of laypeople and ordinary government nurses, the clinics were up and running, the organization said. Thousands of villagers were cramming the waiting rooms to test for HIV. And the shelves were stocked with drugs. By the time I made contact with MSF in mid-2005, a thousand people were on ARVs. </p><p> The program was run by an MSF doctor called Hermann Reuter. He is to occupy quite a few of the pages that follow. Reuter's guiding proposition was quite simple: If you provide treatment that works, people will come and get it. If you provide poor treatment, make people stand in lines, or shunt them from one institution to another, they will look elsewhere for succor, or they will stay at home and die. His work was that of a medical missionary: he wanted to show that you could provide decent AIDS treatment anywhere, even in places that had long ago been routed, and that if you did so, people would come forward. </p><p> I went to Lusikisiki deeply skeptical of Reuter's evangelical simplicity. While I wanted to resist the stance of the morbidly fascinated, I suspected that things in Lusikisiki were a lot more complicated than he made out. And it did not take long to find people who lived close to a clinic staying at home and dying. The question was why. </p><p> If the brochures produced by the area's negligible tourist industry are to be believed, Lusikisiki owes its name to the sound of the wind moving through reeds. According to locals, the word does not mean anything, or if it once did, its meaning is lost to memory. In any case, they say, <i>Lusikisiki</i> refers to two things: the town center with its commercial street and its smattering of suburban-like homes, and the thirty-six or so villages scattered around it in a forty-mile radius. </p><p> It is not an easy place to describe. Were you to read its economic data off a spreadsheet without seeing it in the flesh you might think it was a depressed inner-city zone. The majority of adults are un- or underemployed, and most households get their income either by cheap, unskilled labor, or survivalist self-employment, or government grants. </p><p> And yet its physical setting is anything but urban. Lusikisiki's 150,000-odd people live in about three dozen villages spread liberally over a spirited, temperamental landscape. Streams and rivers run through villages flanked by wild forests; cows, horses, and goats graze off deep green grassland; the villages along the seaboard stand on high cliffs and command breathtaking views of the ocean. Wandering through this place, it takes dogged labor to remind oneself that its political economy is no longer rural, that almost everyone you meet is either unemployed, or in a job that earns less than a thousand rand a month (roughly equivalent to 140 U.S. dollars), or is the recipient of a grant. </p><p> You know it, however, when you leave the villages and make your way to Lusikisiki's town center. There you see what transpires when a single market street becomes the focal point for 150,000 residents of a rural district who must come to one central throughway to purchase everything in their lives, from the food in their stomachs to the tin roofs over their heads. There is no place to move -- not in a car, not on foot, not inside the massive warehouse stores. The rows of hawkers push the pedestrians off the pavements and into the streets, leaving a narrow tunnel for the cars. And there are too many cars. Five days a week, eight hours a day, the street is dense with people, metal, noise, and a cloud of carbon. By seven in the evening it is quiet and empty. </p><p> At first I thought that this anomaly between the rural landscape and the urban profile was simply a symptom of my outsider's incomprehension. Yet I soon discovered that the villagers were as confused as I was, that they themselves felt the place to be in a painful and extended interregnum, and that it was this state of affairs that shaped the meaning of the AIDS epidemic. </p><p> More than a century ago, Lusikisiki was the capital of Eastern Pondoland, the last independent black polity in these parts to surrender its independence to the British. Political defeat spawned economic defeat; its economy hobbled by its political impotence, the men of Eastern Pondoland began working nine or ten months a year in Johannesburg's gold mines some six hundred miles away, beginning a pattern of circular migration that would persist throughout the twentieth century. </p><p> The kingdom's subjugation took a new and cynical form in 1963, when it was incorporated into the northeastern reaches of the Transkei, one of apartheid's notorious old bantustans, the separate "homelands" in which black South Africans could claim citizenship and whose sovereignty was recognized only by South Africa and its most credulous allies. Until the early 1990s, the Transkei was run by a succession of small-time dictators, among them callous and expedient men, their regimes heavily underwritten by the apartheid government. </p><p> As a reservoir of cheap labor for Johannesburg's gold mines and a dumping ground on the margins of South Africa's economy, Transkei districts such as Lusikisiki are no strangers to chronic illness. For the last eighty years, at least three out of four residents have incubated the tuberculosis bacillus, a disease that plagued South Africa's gold mine workers and their rural families throughout the twentieth c...</p></p><h2>Homeopathic Mind Maps Remedies Mineral Kingdom</h2><p>In three volumes Alicia lays out the remedies in a visual form that illustrates the unfolding nature of each remedy. The presentation gives a full view of the materia medica at a sweeping glance, and also allows the homeopath to easily follow the development from deepest mental beliefs to the resultant pathology in a flowing, logical pattern. Homeopathic mind maps are not a new idea, however, the form that Alicias mind maps follow is completely unique. It is a stream of consciousness, giving a multi-dimensional view of the remedies which we have never seen before. Whilst very complex for the author to create, they actually transform our view of the individual remedies into lovely simplicity. Whilst Alicias mind map books are written for homeopaths, and are exceptionally useful as teaching resources for materia medica, they are also of interest to the layman. Each book is enriched with history, chemistry, mythology, herbal lore, folklore, etymology, taxonomy and a wealth of other resources that enhance our understanding of the substance. Each mind map is brought to vividly expressive life with an apt photograph. The books are beautifully produced on high quality paper, in glorious colour and with a wire binding that allows the reader to double the book back on itself, making the book very simple to hold and taking up much less room on the desktop. Once you hold these marvellous books in your hands you wont want to put them down again!</p><p></p><h2>The Kreeger Museum</h2><p>The Kreeger Museum in Washington, DC is a private, non-profit art museum located in the former residence of David and Carmen Kreeger. Designed by renowned architect Philip Johnson, it showcases the Kreegers&#39; permanent collection of 19th and 20th century paintings and sculptures. Highlights of the collection include works by Claude Monet, Vincent van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cezanne, Auguste Rodin and Joan Miro as well as examples of traditional African and Asian Art. Through 224 pages and 401 color images, the first Kreeger Museum Catalogue takes the reader on a visual voyage through the remarkable permanent collection which David and Carmen Kreeger acquired from 1952 to 1988. The Preface written by Trustees Carol Kreeger Ingall and Peter L. Kreeger, the daughter and son of David and Carmen, is a particularly touching, first-hand view of the beginnings of the collection to the workings of the Museum at present. The Kreeger Museum&#39;s Head of Education, Erich Keel gives an institutional perspective through his portrait of David Lloyd Kreeger as collector. Finally, Benjamin Forgey, author and former architectural critic for the Washington Post, contributes an enthusiastic and insightful essay on Philip Johnson&#39;s building. The color plates are divided into five chapters: Landscape, Still Life Painting, The Figure, Art of the Sacred, and Abstraction. Each section features an interpretive essay by one of the three highly accomplished art historians: Jonathan P. Binstock, curator, author, and senior vice president of Citigroup&#39;s Art Advisory Group; Laura Coyle, founder of Curator-at-Large; and Ori Z. Soltes, Goldman Professorial Lecturer in Theology and Fine Arts, Georgetown University.</p><p></p><h2>Parrots: Their care and breeding</h2><p>PARROTS, THEIR CARE AND BREEDING is the most comprehensive coverage of the parrot family in captivity to have appeared in any language In recent years there has been a necessary shift of emphasis among aviculturists, who, since importations have been severely restricted, now concentrate their efforts on breeding from their birds. This book therefore deals very thoroughly with this aspect and includes the experiences of breeders throughout the world, many of them previously unpublished. Parrots are especially interesting as aviary subjects: certain species breed so readily that there are more of them in captivity than in their often shrinking natural habitat; others, however, are extremely difficult to rear under captive conditions. As pets, parrots have been popular for centuries for their intelligence, affectionate nature, engaging personalities and their ability to mimic. The parrot owner who is interested primarily in this aspect will find information on individual species&#39; characteristics throughout the book. Ninety full colour photographs illustrate widely varying species of parrot and include some extremely rare specimens.</p><p></p><h2>A Prayer for Owen Meany</h2><p>, 543 and 554 pages, other ISBN is: 9781408801840, cloth bookmarks in each</p><p>Owen Meany is a dwarfish boy with a strange voice who accidentally kills his best friend's mom with a baseball and believes--accurately--that he is an instrument of God, to be redeemed by martyrdom. John Irving's novel, which inspired the 1998 Jim Carrey movie <i>Simon Birch</i>, is his most popular book in Britain, and perhaps the oddest Christian mystic novel since Flannery O'Connor's work. Irving fans will find much that is familiar: the New England prep-school-town setting, symbolic amputations of man and beast, the Garp-like unknown father of the narrator (Owen's orphaned best friend), the rough comedy. The scene of doltish the doltish headmaster driving a trashed VW down the school's marble staircase is a marvelous set piece. So are the Christmas pageants Owen stars in. But it's all, as <i>Highlights</i> magazine used to put it, "fun with a purpose." When Owen plays baby Jesus in the pageants, and glimpses a tombstone with his death date while enacting <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the slapstick doesn't cancel the fact that he <i>was</i> born to be martyred. The book's countless subplots add up to a moral argument, specifically an indictment of American foreign policy--from Vietnam to the Contras. <p> The book's mystic religiosity is steeped in Robertson Davies's Deptford trilogy, and the fatal baseball relates to the fatefully misdirected snowball in the first Deptford novel, <i>Fifth Business</i>. Tiny, symbolic Owen echoes the hero of Irving's teacher G�nter Grass's <i>The Tin Drum</i>--the two characters share the same initials. A rollicking entertainment, <i>Owen Meany</i> is also a meditation on literature, history, and God. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>I have been a voracious reader since childhood, and while I've read and loved many, many books, I can honestly say that A Prayer for Owen Meany is my all-time favorite! It is such an extraordinarily funny, moving and heartbreaking story and then ending is the best and most satisfying one I've ever read. The highlight of my first year working for Ballantine Books was attending a reading John Irving gave for the paperback publication. Owen Meany has a very memorable voice when you read the book, so you can imagine how exciting it was for me to hear my favorite author read my favorite book and DO THE VOICE OF OWEN MEANY!<br><br>M.

A horror story that shatters the limitations of the genre, The Jade Unicorn takes the reader on a multi-dimensional cyclone from innocence to evil, and from decadence to enlightenment and self-sacrifice. This isn t a book for the squeamish, because the truth about Evil must be told graphically and read without shame. Nor is it a book for genre fans looking for another vampire, ghost, or demon story. The Jade Unicorn will haunt you long after you ve turned the final page.<br><br>The night sounds of the park all ceased. The strange, terrifying scream rose horrible and naked into the night, a scream that was both an outpouring of unspeakable agony and the ecstasy of illicit lust." --From The Jade Unicorn.<br><br>So begins a most savage and brutal murder -- one of three mysterious homicides that boggle the imaginations of even the most hardened members of the coroner's office and the New York City Police Department. From the very beginning of this spellbinding novel of supernatural terror, the clues defy reason, and the prime murder suspect is a killer that even the cops admit cannot possibly exist. <br><br>In The Jade Unicorn, Jay Halpern creates a haunting tale of occult horror that has not been equaled since The Exorcist. A young girl raped and mutilated, a sexton ruthlessly slaughtered, a gay cruiser savagely dismembered in a warehouse near the Morton Street Pier -- a trio of grisly and bizarre murders that are anything but unusual in New York City. Or so the police assume until they begin to put the killings and their peculiar circumstances together. Intertwined with the murders are the lives of Abe Ender, New York's erudite district attorney; Adrienne, the beautiful, well-kept, but thoroughly ignored wife of a wealthy businessman; and Adrienne's sadistic, Satanist husband Mercadante, whose prized jade unicorn amulet Adrienne steals to bestow upon her footloose young lover, Jade. Jade -- an unlikely hero: amoral drug dealer, gigolo, poet with transcendent psychic powers, and ultimately, the chosen being who stands between the world and its destruction. Others are drawn inextricably into the web, as the malignant horror continues. A primitive being stalks the city in quest of vengeance and in search of a bride. And the police stalk the city looking for answers. Noisy, startled, haunted, New York becomes a playground for the surreal, and in a shattering climax to this terrifying tale, an unlikely team of defenders come face-to-face with the world-destroying beast-- and the awesome powers of the jade unicorn.</p><p></p><h2>Boswell: Laird of Auchinleck, 1778-1782</h2><p>It&#39;s 1778, Boswell is now aproaching his 40th birthday, married with three young children and a fourth on its way. His father, the laird of Auchinleck, is ill and dying. Boswell himself is full of both the doubts of middle age and the pleasures of family life. Far removed from the rakish, scholarly and amorous adventures described in earlier journals, &#34;Boswell, Laird of Auchinleck&#34; records Boswell&#39;s daily trials and incidents as he struggles to manage the family estate of Auchinleck in Ayrshire. Full of momentary detail and flashes of self-knowledge, Boswell&#39;s journal is an insight into the mind of the mature diarist.</p><p></p><h2>Voronezh Notebooks (NYRB Poets)</h2><p>Osip Mandelstam is one of the greatest of twentieth-century poets and <i>Voronezh Notebooks</i>, a sequence of poems composed between 1935 and 1937 when he was living in internal exile in the Soviet city of Voronezh, is his last and most exploratory work. Meditating on death and survival, on power and poetry, on marriage, madness, friendship, and memory, challenging Stalin between lines that are full of the sights and sounds of the steppes, blue sky and black earth, the roads, winter breath, spring with its birds and flowers and bees, the notebooks are a continual improvisation and an unapologetic affirmation of poetry as life.</p><p><b>Osip Mandelstam</b> (1891&#x2013;1938) was born and raised in St. Petersburg, where he attended the prestigious Tenishev School, before studying at the universities of St. Petersburg and Heidelberg and at the Sorbonne. Mandelstam first published his poems in <i>Apollyon</i>, an avant-garde magazine, in 1910, then banded together with Anna Akhmatova and Nikolai Gumilev to form the Acmeist movement, which advocated an aesthetic of exact description and chiseled form, as suggested by the title of Mandelstam&#x2019;s first book, <i>Stone</i> (1913). During the Russian Revolution, he left Leningrad for the Crimea and Georgia, and settled in Moscow in 1922,where his second collection of poems,<i> Tristia</i>, appeared. Unpopular with the Soviet authorities, Mandelstam found it increasingly difficult to publish his poetry, though an edition of collected poems did come out in 1928. In 1934, after reading a poem denouncing Stalin to friends, Mandelstam was arrested and sent into exile. He produced many new poems during these years, and his wife, Nadezhda, memorized his work in case his notebooks were destroyed or lost. (Her extraordinary memoirs of life with her husband, <i>Hope Against Hope and Hope Abandoned</i>, published in the 1970s, later helped to bring Mandelstam a worldwide audience.) In 1937, Mandelstam&#x2019;s exile ended and he returned to Moscow, but he was arrested again almost immediately. This time he was sentenced to hard labor in Siberia. He was last seen in a transit camp near Vladivostok.<br><br><b>Andrew Davis</b> is a poet, cabinetmaker, and visual artist. His current project is the long poem IMPLUVIUM.

A compulsive picture-taker, Masopust developed a unique approach to quilt making based on her photos, layering shapes and colors of fabrics onto the design suggested by the original composition. In <i>Ghost Layers &amp; Color Washes</i>, she shares the secrets of her innovative method, explaining the process of creating the base block, adding the ghost layer (abstract or geometric shapes that seem to float through the image), painting a simple watercolor wash on paper to suggest a color scheme, and combining all the layers into a cohesive design. She also explains color sorting, cutting and turning the appliqu� pieces, sewing onto stabilizer, and machine quilting. One project guides readers through the steps of making a fruit-in-a-bowl quilt; several dozen quilts by the author and some of her students offer further ideas for exploring this fascinating technique. <i>--Amy Handy</i>Katie Pasquini Masopust is well known for her mandalas, dimensional quilts, and fractured landscapes.

When he embarked on a new search for buried treasure in the Mediterranean, he knew it was a long shot. When he uncovered a golden disc that spoke of a lost civilization more advanced than any in the ancient world, he started to get excited. But when Jack Howard and his intrepid crew finally got close to uncovering the secrets the sea had held for thousands of years, nothing could have prepared them for what they would find...</p><p>David Gibbins has worked in underwater archaeology all his professional life. After taking a PhD from Cambridge University he taught archaeology in Britain and abroad, and is a world authority on ancient shipwrecks and sunken cities. He has led numerous expeditions to investigate underwater sites in the Mediterranean and around the world. He currently divides his time between fieldwork, England and Canada. This is his first novel.<i>Chapter One</i><br>I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE!"<br><br>The words came from a dry suited diver who had just surfaced behind the stern of the research vessel, his voice breathless with excitement. After swimming over to the ladder, he removed his fins and mask and passed them up to the waiting barge chief. He hauled himself laboriously out of the water, his heavy cylinders causing him momentarily to lose balance, but a heave from above landed him safe and sound on the deck. His dripping shape was quickly surrounded by other members of the team who had been waiting on the dive platform.<br><br>Jack Howard made his way down from the bridge walkway and smiled at his friend. He still found it amazing that such a bulky figure could be so agile underwater. As he negotiated the clutter of dive equipment on the aft deck he called out, his mocking tone a familiar part of their banter over the years.<br><br>"We thought you'd swum back to Athens for a gin and tonic beside your father's pool. What've you found, the lost treasure of the Queen of Sheba?"<br><br>Costas Kazantzakis shook his head impatiently as he struggled along the railing towards Jack. He was too agitated even to bother taking off his equipment. "No," he panted. "I'm serious. Take a look at this."<br><br>Jack silently prayed that the news was good. It had been a solo dive to investigate a silted-up shelf on top of the submerged volcano, and the two divers who had followed Costas would soon be surfacing from the decompression stop. There would be no more dives that season.<br><br>Costas unclipped a carabiner and passed over an underwater camcorder housing, pressing the replay button as he did so. The other members of the team converged behind the tall Englishman as he flipped open the miniature LCD screen and activated the video. Within moments Jack's sceptical grin had given way to a look of blank amazement.<br><br>The underwater scene was illuminated by powerful floodlights which gave colour to the gloom almost one hundred metres below. Two divers were kneeling on the seabed using an airlift, a large vacuum tube fed by a low-pressure air hose which sucked up the silt covering the site. One diver wrestled to keep the airlift in position while the other gently wafted sediment up towards the mouth of the tube, the action revealing artifacts just as an archaeologist on land would use a trowel.<br><br>As the camera zoomed in, the object of the divers' attention came dramatically into view. The dark shape visible upslope was not rock but a concreted mass of metal slabs laid in interlocking rows like shingles.<br><br>"Oxhide ingots," Jack said excitedly. "Hundreds of them. And there's a cushioning layer of brushwood dunnage, just as Homer described in the ship of Odysseus."<br><br>Each slab was about a metre long with protruding corners, their shape resembling the flayed and stretched hide of an ox. They were the characteristic copper ingots of the Bronze Age, dating back more than three and a half thousand years.<br><br>"It looks like the early type," one of the students on the team ventured. "Sixteenth century BC?"<br><br>"Unquestionably," Jack said. "And still in rows just as they were laden, suggesting the hull may be preserved underneath. We could have the oldest ship ever discovered."<br><br>Jack's excitement mounted as the camera traversed down the slope. Between the ingots and the divers loomed three giant pottery jars, each as tall as a man and over a metre in girth. They were identical to jars that Jack had seen in the storerooms at Knossos on Crete. Inside, they could see stacks of stemmed cups painted with beautifully naturalistic octopuses and marine motifs, their swirling forms at one with the undulations of the seabed.<br><br>There was no mistaking the pottery of the Minoans, the remarkable island civilization that flourished at the time of the Egyptian Middle and New Kingdoms but then disappeared suddenly, around 1400 BC. Knossos, the fabled labyrinth of the Minotaur, had been one of the most sensational discoveries of the last century. Following close on the heels of Heinrich Schliemann, excavator of Troy, the English archaeologist Arthur Evans had set out to prove that the legend of the Athenian prince Theseus and his lover Ariadne was as grounded in real events as the Trojan War. The sprawling palace just south of Heraklion was the key to a lost civilization he dubbed Minoan after their legendary king. The maze of passageways and chambers gave extraordinary credence to the story of Theseus' battle with the Minotaur, and showed that the myths of the Greeks centuries later were closer to real history than anyone had dared think.<br><br>"Yes!" Jack punched the air with his free hand, his normal reserve giving way to the emotion of a truly momentous discovery. It was the culmination of years of single-minded passion, the fulfilment of a dream that had driven him since boyhood. It was a find that would rival Tutankhamen&#x2019;s tomb, a discovery that would secure his team front place in the annals of archaeology.<br><br>For Jack these images were enough. Yet there was more, much more, and he stood transfixed by the screen. The camera panned down to the divers on a low shelf below the clump of ingots.<br><br>"Probably the stern compartment." Costas was pointing at the screen. "Just beyond this ledge is a row of stone anchors and a wooden steering oar."<br><br>Immediately in front was an area of shimmering yellow which looked like the reflection of the floodlights off the sediment in the water. As the camera zoomed in, there was a collective gasp of astonishment.<br><br>"That's not sand," the student whispered. "That's gold!"<br><br>Now they knew what they were looking at, the image was one of surpassing splendour. In the centre was a magnificent golden chalice fit for King Minos himself. It was decorated in relief with an elaborate bullfighting scene. Alongside lay a life-sized golden statue of a woman, her arms raised in supplication and her headdress wreathed in snakes. Her bare breasts had been sculpted from ivory, and a flickering arc of colour showed where her neck was embellished with jewels. Nestled in front was a bundle of golden-handled bronze swords, their blades decorated with fighting scenes made from inlaid silver and blue enamel.<br><br>The most brilliant reflection came from the area just in front of the divers. Each waft of the hand seemed to reveal another gleaming object. Jack could make out gold bars, royal seals, jewellery and delicate diadem crowns of intertwined leaves, all jumbled together as if they had once been inside a treasure chest.<br><br>The view suddenly veered up towards the ascent line and the screen abruptly went blank. In the stunned silence that followed, Jack lowered the camera and looked at Costas.<br><br>"I think we're in business," he said quietly.<br><br> ***<br><br> Jack had staked his reputation on a far-flung proposal. In the decade since completing his doctorate he had become fixated on discovering a Minoan wreck, a find that would clinch his theory about the maritime supremacy of the Minoans in the Bronze Age. He had become convinced that the most likely spot was a group of reefs and islets some seventy nautical miles north-east of Knossos.<br><br>Yet for weeks they had searched in vain. A few days earlier their hopes had been raised and then dashed by the discovery of a Roman wreck, a dive Jack expected to be his last of the season. Today was to have been a chance to evaluate new equipment for their next project. Once again Jack's luck had held out.<br><br>"Mind giving me a hand?"<br><br>Costas had slumped exhausted beside the stern railing on <i>Seaquest</i>, his equipment still unbuckled and the water on his face now joined by rivulets of sweat. The late afternoon sun of the Aegean drenched his form in light. He looked up at the lean physique that towered over him. Jack was an unlikely scion of one of England's most ancient families, his easy grace the only hint of a privileged lineage. His father had been an adventurer who had eschewed his background and used his wealth to take his family away with him to remote locations around the world. His unconventional upbringing had left Jack an outsider, a man most at ease in his own company and beholden to nobody. He was a born leader who commanded respect on the bridge and the foredeck.<br><br>"What would you do without me?" Jack asked with a grin as he lifted the tanks off Costas' back.<br><br>The son of a Greek shipping tycoon, Costas had spurned the playboy lifestyle which was his for the asking and opted for ten years at Stanford and MIT, emerging as an expert in submersible technology. Surrounded by a vast jumble of tools and parts that only he could navigate, Costas would routinely conjure up wondrous inventions like some latter-day Caractacus Pott. His passion for a challenge was matched by his gregarious nature, a vital asset in a profession where teamwork was essential.<br><br>The two men had first met at the NATO base at Izmir in Turkey when Jack had been seconded to the Naval Intelligence School and Costas was a civilian adviser to UNANTSUB, the United Nations anti-submarine warfare research establishment. A few years later Jack invited Costas to join him at the International Maritime University, the research institution which had been their home for more than ten years now. In that time Jack had seen his remit as director of field operations at IMU grow to four ships and more than two hundred personnel, and despite an equally burgeoning role in the engineering department, Costas always seemed to find a way to join Jack when things got exciting.<br><br>"Thanks, Jack." Costas slowly stood up, too tired to say more. He only stood as high as Jack's shoulders and had a barrel chest and forearms inherited from generations of Greek sponge fishermen and sailors, with a personality to match. This project had been close to his heart as well, and he was suddenly drained by the excitement of discovery. It was he who had set the expedition in train, using his father's connections with the Greek government. Although they were now in international waters, the support of the Hellenic Navy had been invaluable, not least in keeping them supplied with the cylinders of purified gas which were vital for trimix diving.<br><br>"Oh, I almost forgot." Costas' round, tanned face broke into a grin as he reached into his stabilizer jacket. "Just in case you thought I'd faked the whole thing."<br><br>He extracted a package swaddled in protective neoprene and handed it over, a triumphant gleam in his eye. Jack was unprepared for the weight and his hand momentarily dropped. He undid the wrapping and gasped in astonishment.<br><br>It was a solid metal disc about the diameter of his hand, its surface as lustrous as if it were brand new. There was no mistaking the deep hue of unalloyed gold, a gold refined to the purity of bullion.<br><br>Unlike many of his academic colleagues Jack never pretended to be unmoved by treasure, and for a moment he let the thrill of holding several kilogrammes of gold wash through him. As he held it up and angled it towards the sun, the disc gave off a dazzling flash of light, as if it were releasing a great burst of energy pent up over the millennia.<br><br>He was even more elated when he saw the sun glint off markings on the surface. He lowered the disc into Costas' shadow and traced his fingers over the indentations, all of them exquisitely executed on one convex side.<br><br>In the centre was a curious rectilinear device, like a large letter H, with a short line dropping from the crossbar and four lines extending like combs from either side. Around the edge of the disc were three concentric bands, each one divided into twenty compartments. Each compartment contained a different symbol stamped into the metal. To Jack the outer circle looked like pictograms, symbols that conveyed the meaning of a word or phrase. At a glance he could make out a man's head, a walking man, a paddle, a boat and a sheaf of corn. The inner compartments were aligned with those along the edge, but instead contained linear signs. Each of these was different but they seemed more akin to letters of the alphabet than to pictograms.<br><br>Costas stood and watched Jack examine the disc, totally absorbed. His eyes were alight in a way Costas had seen before. Jack was touching the Age of Heroes, a time shrouded in myth and legend, yet a period which had been spectacularly revealed in great palaces and citadels, in sublime works of art and brilliantly honed weapons of war. He was communing with the ancients in a way that was only possible with a shipwreck, holding a priceless artefact that had not been tossed away but had been cherished to the moment of catastrophe. Yet it was an artefact shrouded in mystery, one he knew would draw him on without respite until all its secrets were out.<br><br>Jack turned the disc over several times and looked at the inscriptions again, his mind racing back to undergraduate courses on the history of writing. He had seen something like this before. He made a mental note to email the image to Professor James Dillen, his old mentor at Cambridge University and the world's leading authority on the ancient scripts of Greece.<br><br>Jack passed the disc back to Costas. For a moment the two men looked at each other, their eyes ablaze with excitement. Jack hurried over to join the team kitting up beside the stern ladder. The sight of all that gold had redoubled his fervour. The greatest threat to archaeology lay in international waters, a free-for-all where no country held jurisdiction. Every attempt to impose a global sea law had ended in failure. The problems of policing such a huge area seemed insurmountable. Yet advances in technology meant that remote-operated submersibles, of the type used to discover the <i>Titanic</i>, were now little more expensive than a car. Deep-water exploration that was once the preserve of a few institutes was now open to all, and had led to the wholesale destruction of historic sites. Organized pillagers with state-of-the-art technology were stripping the seabed with no record being made for posterity and artefacts disappearing for ever into the hands of private collectors. And the IMU teams were not only up against legitimate operators. Looted antiquities had become major currency in the criminal underworld.<br><br>Jack glanced up at the timekeeper's platform and felt a familiar surge of adrenaline as he signalled his intention to dive. He began carefully to assemble his equipment, setting his dive computer and checking the pressure of his cylinders, his demeanour methodical and professional as if there were nothing special about this day.<br><br>In truth he could barely contain his excitement.</p><h2>Earthbound: David Bowie and The Man Who Fell To Earth</h2><p><p>'Before there was Star Wars ... before there was Close Encounters ... there was The Man Who Fell To Earth.' - advertising tag line for 1981 reissue of the film.</p><p>Earthbound is the first book-length exploration of a true classic of twentieth-century science-fiction cinema, shot under the heavy, ethereal skies of New Mexico by the legendary British director Nicolas Roeg and starring David Bowie in a role he seemed born for as an extraterrestrial named Thomas Newton who comes to Earth in search of water. Based on a novel by the highly regarded American writer Walter Tevis, this dreamy, distressing, and visionary film resonates even more strongly in the twenty-first century than it did on its original release during the year of the US Bicentennial.</p><p>Drawing on extensive research and exclusive first-hand interviews with members of the cast and crew, Earthbound begins with a look at Tevis's 1963 novel before moving into a detailed analysis of a film described by its director as 'a sci-fi film without a lot of sci-fi tools' and starring a group of actors - Bowie, Buck Henry, Candy Clark, Rip Torn - later described by one of them (Henry) as 'not a cast but a dinner party.' It also seeks to uncover the mysteries surrounding Bowie's rejected soundtrack to the film (elements of which later ended up his groundbreaking 1977 album Low) and closes with a look at his return to the themes and characters of The Man Who Fell To Earth in one of his final works, the acclaimed musical production Lazarus.</p></p><p><p><b> Susan Compo</b> is the author of Warren Oates: A Wild Life, as well as three works of fiction plus some music and sports journalism.

Burdon was ripped off by unscrupulous agents, accountants, and record labels, hounded by the police, and framed for a crime he didn&#x2019;t commit. Yet through it all, he never became bitter. He was the first rocker to play behind the Iron Curtain. He sang with Jimi Hendrix, chased Jim Morrison out of his house with a .44, and introduced John Lee Hooker to the toughest venue Hooker ever played. Eric Burdon explains how he became the &#x201c;Egg Man&#x201d; in the Beatles&#x2019; &#x201c;I am the Walrus.&#x201d; With the enthusiasm and good humor of his live shows, Burdon recalls the tense reunion between John Lennon and Lennon&#x2019;s long-estranged father; racing motorcycles across the California desert with Steve McQueen; picketing the offices of MGM Records for nonpayment of royalties; performing in wartime Sarajevo with a symphony orchestra; getting run out of Meridian, Mississippi for promoting black music, and singing his heart out year after year.

Once and always the lead singer of the Animals (as well as the lead for Eric Burdon and the New Animals and Eric Burdon and War), he recounts riding the crest of the British Invasion, moving to L.A., and birthing San Francisco's psychedelic rock scene; getting drunk, laid and stoned; hanging out with the likes of Lennon, Hendrix and Morrison; and spotting Elvis. In one revealing (if not disenchanting) bit, Burdon tells the whys and hows of being the Eggman of the Beatles's song "I Am the Walrus." He also elaborates on his longstanding dismay with the recording industry eloquently captured in a low moment when he "drunkenly" tried to play a gold record he'd received ("It wasn't a chart-topping Animals album at all it was an old Connie Francis record") and gripes about getting ripped off for arrangement rights to the Animals' version of "House of the Rising Sun." This book is a celebration of tried-and-true music, but other new memoirs prove more engaging (see Gene Simmons bio, above). While this account is a primary source for the history of rock 'n' roll, readers may find this story of an overindulgent, middling rocker burdensome. Photos. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>In his first autobiography, I Used To Be an Animal, but I'm All Right Now (1986. o.p.), Burdon recounted his youth and rowdy years as lead singer of British R&amp;B-sters the Animals. Here, he presents a pastiche of anecdotes from the last 30 years, with relatively little space devoted to the band that got him inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Not many Sixties icons could get away with two memoirs, but Burdon has been around the block and then some, and he regales readers with plenty of new tales. Take, for instance, his bizarre stint in a German prison, his trek into Israel's Negev Desert, and a visit to the actual House of the Rising Sun (the New Orleans whorehouse that inspired the Animals' biggest hit). Also covered are both ill-fated Animal reunions and the business deals that probably cost the author millions. Those wanting a history of the Animals are better off hunting down Burdon's previous book or Sean Egan's Animal Tracks (Helter Skelter, 2001). Still, these reminiscences will delight Burdon's fans (a fine discography is also included) and followers of British Invasion rock in general. Recommended. Lloyd Jansen, Stockton-San Joaquin Cty.

Located in what is now southern Turkey, Antioch was the capital of Ancient Syria, a vital marketplace at the crossroads between East and West. It was here that St. Paul preached to the first gentile community to be called "Christians" and where a Greek-speaking Jewish culture flourished alongside Roman, Egyptian, and Near Eastern cults. A large middle-class shared in the wealth and culture of the city, and art abounded in numerous forms, especially in beautiful mosaics depicting scenes from mythology and everyday life. Featuring 118 objects excavated from the city's ruins, all reproduced in full color, Antioch: The Lost Ancient City recreates the spatial sensation, visual splendor, and cultural richness of this urban center.</p><br><p>Devastated by an earthquake in 526 C.E., as well as by fires, plagues and invasions by Persians, Antioch survived only in memory through ancient written accounts until the 1930s, when excavations revealed a wealth of finds from the private houses of its inhabitants, including a large cache of floor mosaics. In addition, archaeologists found several churches, a stadium, a circus, a theater, and several baths. This catalog displays and describes the excavated artifacts--mosaics, sculpture, glass, metalwork, coins--within their architectural and cultural contexts, thereby evoking the street life as well as the domestic lives of Antioch's citizens. Among the treasures are the mosaics <i>The Drinking Contest between Dionysos and Herakles</i> and <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>, the Antioch chalice, gold jewelry from Syria, bronze tyche figurines, and mosaics of river and sea deities. Antioch emerges as a compelling model of a melting-pot city, one that challenges our own notions of civic community and diversity.</p><br><p>The contributors are Susan Boyd, Bernadette Brooten, John J.

This volume reproduces one such collection &#x2015; an extremely rare and valuable portfolio of 376 motifs assembled more than a century ago by two French Jesuit scholars. <br>Relying on historical wall and floor tiles, textile patterns, tapestries, wall hangings, and other designs originating in the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and later European and Islamic cultures, Charles Cahier (1807&#x2013;1882) and Arthur Martin (1802&#x2013;1856) produced a work of true artistic distinction. Included are a wealth of splendid floral, animal, bird, and geometric patterns, carefully researched and meticulously redrawn for use in a myriad of graphic and artistic projects. Many of the motifs are accompanied by complementary border designs, an often essential accessory. <br>This edition faithfully reproduces the edition published in 1868, titled <i>Suite aux m�langes d'arch�ologie</i>. It represents an invaluable copyright-free resource embodying the finest designs from historic sources, ready for use by artists, illustrators, craftspeople, and designers working with textiles, wallpapers, interior decoration, and other projects.</p><p></p><h2>Bookbinding and Conservation by Hand: A Working Guide</h2><p>Explains how books are designed and bound, gives advice on basic and advanced binding techniques, and shows how to repair damaged books</p><p>Laura S.

From Mary's meeting with the angel Gabriel to the birth of baby Jesus in a stable, to the visit of the shepherds and the three wise men, the story is rich in imagery and symbolism. Here, in a triumph of glorious art, is that wondrous story excerpted from the Gospels of Luke and Matthew from the<i> King James Bible</i>. <br><br>Gennady Spirin has been described in the Boston Globe as an artist who "truly represents the picture book as an object of art." In T<i>he Christmas Story</i>, his paintings are luminous and reverent. Drawing on both his classical training at the Stroganov Academy of Fine Arts in Moscow and his Orthodox Christian faith, Mr. Spirin has created a work of art to be passed from generation to generation.<br></p><p>Award-winning illustrator Gennady Spirin (<i>The Sea King's Daughters</i> and <i>The Crane Wife</i>) brings his glorious paintbrush to the Passion play. When you want to introduce children to the actual biblical words that recount Christ's birth, this is the book to reach for. Spirin's paintings are reminiscent of the Renaissance masters, with a sundry of wine reds, creamy whites, celestial blues, and sun-burnt browns all gilded in Italian gold. When Gabriel visits Mary he descends from heaven in a mist of wispy clouds. A gold halo frames his sincere face, and in his hand he carries an offering of a white lily. When Gabriel explains the enormous task that is being asked of Mary, she finally agrees, saying, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word." Spirin then closes in on Mary's young face--her downcast eyes and lightly pursed lips holding oceans of fear and faith. And when heaven celebrates the arrival of Jesus, the page looks as though it's been plucked from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. These are the kind of illustrations that linger with children like guardian angels--forever imprinting beautiful images upon the story of Christ's birth. (Click to see a sample spread.

As if there were not enough challenges facing the crew, they soon suspect there is an agent of the Ethicals among their number, plotting their destruction....</p></p><p><i>The Dark Design</i> is the third book in the epic Riverworld saga, in which almost all of humanity has been resurrected on a strange planet along the shores of a river 22 million miles long. But why have humans been given another chance at life, and who is behind it all? That's what Sir Richard Francis Burton and Sam Clemens set out to discover in two earlier novels, one by riding the "suicide express" (if you die on Riverworld, you're resurrected again at a random point along the river) and the other steaming on the greatest riverboat ever seen. Now Milton Firebrass, Clemens's former enemy and now his No. 1 lieutenant, is planning to use the dwindling iron supply on the Riverworld to create a great airship, which can fly to the North Polar Sea far more quickly than any boat can travel. There he hopes to learn the secret of the mysterious tower thought to house the beings who created this planet.<p> Jill Gulbirra does not care as much about the mission as she wants the chance to captain the great airship, which in all likelihood will be the last airship ever constructed by humankind. But in landing the coveted role, she faces stiff competition--especially from the greatest swordsman of all time, Cyrano de Bergerac, who turns out to be a natural pilot. But even if Jill can win the command of the airship and even if the ship can reach the river's headwaters, there is no guarantee it can get through the mountain wall that surrounds the tower. And it's likely that one or more agents of the Ethicals--the creators of Riverworld--are on board the airship, plotting its downfall. Worse still, somewhere along the way the airship is sure to encounter the <i>Rex Grandissimus</i>, the steamboat stolen by Sam's archnemesis, King John Lackland. <i>--Craig E. Engler</i></p>Years have passed on Riverworld. Entire nations have risen, and savage wars have been fought--all since the dead of Earth found themselves resurrected in their magnificent new homeworld. Yet the truth about the Ethicals, the powerful engineers of this mysterious "afterlife," remains unknown. But a curious cross-section of humanity is determined to change that situation . . . at any cost. <br>Intrepid explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton leads the most remarkable voyage of discovery he has ever undertaken. Hot on his heels are Samuel Clemens, King John of England, and Cyrano de Bergerac. Spurred by the promise of ultimate answers, they chart a course across the vast polar sea--and toward the awesome tower that looms above it. But getting there will be more than half the battle.

Major? I'm sorry to wake you, sir, but the train has arrived at Waterloo and you'll have to disembark."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack Skelton jerked too fast from deep sleep into wakefulness, and for several disorienting moments stared into the face of the conductor leaning over him, his mind unable to let go the dream images that skidded through it.<br>&nbsp;<br>Frank Bentley and his insipid wife, Violet. Stella Wentworth, standing beautiful and untouchable under the embankment light. Matilda and Ecub, suburban housewives in dressing gowns. Asterion--Weyland Orr--taking him to Pen Hill. Faerie Hill Manor, and both the Lord of the Faerie and the king of England, George VI, waiting for him.<br>&nbsp;<br>Grace--everyone's doom.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Sir, I must ask you to--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes, yes. I'm awake." Jack Skelton struggled to his feet, one hand clutching at the overhead luggage rack for support as his head reeled.<br>&nbsp;<br>The conductor stepped back. "It's been a bad few days, sir," he said, watching the American major curiously as he straightened his tie and uniform jacket, then lifted his greatcoat down from the rack. He wondered why the American was here, and hoped that it might be some indication that the Yanks wouldn't leave it as long to help out in this war as they had left it the last. "We've heard news on the wireless that the PM has sent an ultimatum to the Nazis. Get out of Poland or we'll go to war."<br>&nbsp;<br>The conductor paused, his face glum. "No chance that the Germans will back off, d'you think, major?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally fully awake and oriented, Jack studied the man, knowing there was no chance for peace, and wondering if the man wanted false reassurances or the truth.<br>&nbsp;<br>"It is too late now," he said. "I'm sorry."<br>&nbsp;<br>The conductor's face tightened, and he gave a small nod. "Let me help you with your bag, sir."<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Once on the platform, Jack tipped the conductor then stood motionless, looking about. Because he'd been so deeply asleep when the train had pulled in, and had probably then slept for fifteen minutes or more before the conductor woke him up, most of the other passengers had departed, and now the great cavernous space of Waterloo Station was all but deserted. He shivered, and tried to put it down to the cold night air.<br>&nbsp;<br>The conductor had got back on the train, and now the platform was empty save for himself and several baggage handlers at the far end of the train, standing about an empty trolley, smoking and talking.<br>&nbsp;<br>About the forthcoming war, no doubt. The Germans had invaded Poland earlier today, and war was inevitable. Jack could feel it seeping over the vast stretches of land and water between where he stood and where the Poles battled desperately. It was only a matter of time before it reached London.<br>&nbsp;<br>He shivered again, and hunched deeper into his greatcoat, lighting his own cigarette then flicking the match away. He drew a deep breath, taking comfort in the smoke. Jack had first come to this land almost three and a half thousand years ago as Brutus, the exiled Trojan prince. With Genvissa he'd thought to resurrect the ancient Troy Game, but everything had fallen apart when his then-wife, Cornelia, had murdered Genvissa before they could complete the game. For three and a half thousand years Jack had--as Brutus, then as William, Duke of Normandy, and subsequently Louis de Silva--fought to finish what he had started so long ago. But always events and people (and that mostly Cornelia in her rebirth as Caela and then Noah) conspired to prevent him.<br>&nbsp;<br>God, how long had it been since he'd last been in England? Almost three hundred years, give or take a decade or two. Oh, he'd come back briefly now and then, stepping through the realm of the Faerie, to meet with either Coel, the Lord of the Faerie, or with his father, Silvius, but apart from those fleeting visits . . . nothing. He'd walked away from the smoking ruins of London in 1666, walked away from the disaster of his hopes and dreams.<br>&nbsp;<br>Walked away from Noah, who had abandoned her love for him to live with Asterion, and give him a child.<br>&nbsp;<br>Walked away from the Troy Game.<br>&nbsp;<br>Walked away from it all.<br>&nbsp;<br>To roam.<br>&nbsp;<br>He'd wandered first in the form of Louis de Silva rather than in his magical form of Ringwalker. He'd gone back to his father's estates in France, and from there, desperate, restless, angry beyond knowing, he'd drifted through the forests and fields and pleasure halls of Europe. Then, as the years passed, he assumed the form of a priest, because in his anger that amused him, and desecrated his way through Egypt and Arabia. From there, to India, and then even farther east, and as the decades spun by and his resentment and bewilderment at what had happened deepened, he became a sailor in a Portuguese man-of-war that had berthed in the Philippines, and fought and squandered his way across the oceans of the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then he'd landed in America--new and brash and uncaring--and here Jack had found a home. He settled in the Appalachian mountains, finding solace in their high mountain lakes and dark forests. He lived there for a hundred years or more, spending more and more time not as a man but as Ringwalker, the name he took when he assumed the mantle of the ancient Stag God, roaming the wild paths and tracks through the wilderness as he had once roamed the forests in England.<br>&nbsp;<br>He found peace, and a renewed purpose. It was about this time, perhaps almost two hundred years after the Great Fire of London, that Jack made contact with the Lord of the Faerie again. Just a touch, a glimmer of friendship sent through the Faerie, but it was enough to begin rebuilding the bonds between them. From that point they'd met once every five or six years, sometimes in the forests of America, sometimes in the Faerie. These meetings lasted only a short while, less than an hour, and they rarely talked. They just spent time together.<br>&nbsp;<br>About forty years ago, when they'd met in a lonely spot of the Faerie, the Lord of the Faerie had put his hand on Ringwalker's shoulder, and said, "My friend, John Thornton is back, a prince of the realm now. Loth is back also, and as wedded to the Christian church as he was when last he walked."<br>&nbsp;<br>Ringwalker had tensed. "The others?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"None of the rest of us had to be reborn. We have all done much as you have for the past few hundred years--moved in and out of the Faerie and in and out of mortal form as it suited us. Apart from John and Loth, we've all gone too far to be trapped by birth and death now."<br>&nbsp;<br>We're all way too powerful. Too fey.<br>&nbsp;<br>"And her? Is she still with him?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Noah? With Weyland? Of course, for they love each other deeply. Ringwalker, please, the land needs you back. We need you back. All of us."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I don't think I can--"<br>&nbsp;<br>"You must," the Lord of the Faerie had said quietly, and Ringwalker had bowed his head in acceptance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Five months ago dreams began to pervade Jack's sleep. Each night, over and over, he dreamed of arriving in London, meeting with a nervous man called Frank Bentley, then walking about London, meeting in turn each of the people who had become caught up in the Troy Game.<br>&nbsp;<br>Everyone save Noah.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack never met Noah in his dreams.<br>&nbsp;<br>He knew what the dreams meant. It was time to go back. Time to move.<br>&nbsp;<br>Time to find Noah.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so now here he was, Major Jack Skelton, standing on the empty platform at Waterloo Station at ten p.m. waiting for someone to meet him. Jack had sent word (together with a request he hoped the Lord of the Faerie could accommodate) a week ago that he'd be here. Surely they'd send someone.<br>&nbsp;<br>Who?<br>&nbsp;<br>Noah? No, they'd not dare. Stella, perhaps--the Lord of the Faerie had told Jack of the name Genvissa-reborn used when she stepped out into the mortal world.<br>&nbsp;<br>Would the Lord of the Faerie come himself?<br>&nbsp;<br>Would the Troy Game meet him?<br>&nbsp;<br>Not the Frank Bentley from his dreams, surely. Please let Frank be a figment of his dreaming mind . . . please . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>Then Jack saw him. A tall, imposing figure striding onto the platform from the gate that led to the station concourse. A black trilby pulled down low over his brow. Flapping overcoat, beautifully cut, over an equally well tailored two-piece, double-breasted suit. A red silk scarf rippling at his throat. Matching leather gloves which the man was even now pulling off and stuffing into the pockets of his coat.<br>&nbsp;<br>A gleaming smile in a swarthy face, redolent with mischief.<br>&nbsp;<br>Not Frank Bentley.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Jack!" The man held out his arms, and Jack laughed, and stepped into them.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Silvius!"<br>&nbsp;<br>His father grabbed him into a huge bear hug, almost lifting Jack off his feet. Jack hugged him back, and then both men were laughing, and leaning back from each other.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Jack! Is there ever an incarnation you're willing to make when you're not as handsome as the worst renegade pirate?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"How can I help that, with your blood in me?"<br>&nbsp;<br>They fell silent, both men grinning hugely, unable to help themselves. For many thousands of years there had been nothing but hatred and guilt between them. During the Bronze Age Silvius had been a Trojan prince, living in exile in Alba after the Greeks had sacked and destroyed Troy. As a prince of Troy Silvius had also been a Kingman--one trained in the ancient Aegean mysteries of the Game, a labyrinthine enchantment that a Kingman and his female counterpart, a Mistress of the Labyrinth, constructed via dance and magic in order to protect a city. Brutus, Silvius' fifteen-year-old son, had wanted his father's titles and powers, and had taken the first possible opportunity to murder his father. Brutus seized Silvius' six golden Kingship bands of Troy, magical limb bands that enhanced the wearer's Kingman powers, and eventually found his way to the island of Britain, then called Llangarlia. Here, with Genvissa, a Mistress of the Labyrinth and Darkwitch, he had resurrected the Troy Game in order to found London. But Brutus had used his father's murder to infuse the Game with power, and for thousands of years Silvius had been trapped in the vile dark heart of the labyrinth which lay at the center of the Troy Game (and which, in its physical form, lay under St. Paul's Cathedral in the center of London). It was only during Jack's last life as Louis de Silva that Silvius had managed to escape from the labyrinth's heart. Silvius and Brutus could have continued their hatred, but instead they had managed to set their violent past behind them, and understand that all the other one had ever wanted was approval, and love.<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvius' hands tightened on Jack's shoulders, and he sobered. "I'm glad you're back. We all are."<br>&nbsp;<br>"All?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"All of us, Jack."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack wasn't so sure of that. It wasn't just he and his father who had a history of discord; Jack had a complex history of love and betrayal with most of the people caught up in the Troy Game: Cornelia, the wife he had originally despised and then come to love in her reincarnations as Caela and Noah, had betrayed him with Asterion, the creature who had lived at the dark heart of the labyrinth on Crete and who now lived as Weyland Orr; Asterion himself, who had not only stolen Noah from him, but had also spent thousands of years trying to wrest control of the Troy Game away from Jack; Genvissa, the Mistress who had originally allied herself with Jack and who had then betrayed him to Asterion; Coel, a Llangarlian man who Jack, as Brutus, had murdered but who was now Jack's friend and ally as the Lord of the Faerie; Loth, a Llangarlian priest who had always fought against both Jack and the Troy Game; Ariadne, the ancient Darkwitch who, as Asterion's lover, had begun the series of events that had culminated in the destruction of Troy; and, last but not least, the Troy Game itself, which had taken the form of a little girl called Catling, and manipulated everyone in her effort to finally achieve completion. Jack found it hard to believe that any of these people, save his father and the Lord of the Faerie, were really "glad" to have him back. They might need him--almost everyone save Jack himself, who remained noncommittal on the subject, needed Jack if they wanted any chance of destroying the Troy Game, which most had come to see as evil incarnate--but Jack did not believe for an instant they were happy to have him here.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We need you, Jack," Silvius said softly, still holding on to Jack's shoulders.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ah, that's better. Yes, you all need me, but I doubt all of you are "glad" at my return.<br>&nbsp;<br>"You're a cynical laddie," Silvius said, finally letting his son go and bending down to grab Jack's holdall. "God knows where you picked that up."<br>&nbsp;<br>Jack grinned again, his humor restored, and stubbed out his cigarette under his shoe. "And you, father? What is this form you step out in? Do I detect an Italian accent in your voice?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvius nodded toward the concourse, and they started to walk toward the gate at the end of the platform. "Mr. Silvius Makris, esquire, at your service," he said. "And a vaguely Mediterranean birth, if you please, not Italian. Not in this milieu in which we live."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And what does Mr. Silvius Makris do in this modern world, eh?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Silvius grinned again. "He mixes with the best crowd, don't you know, flaunting vague hints of an industrial fortune at his back, and buying the jolly crowd at the dance halls and nightclubs as many cocktails as they can manage before management has to drag them out by their coattails and mink stoles."<br>&nbsp;<br>"A somewhat jolly but shallow existence, Silvius?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Beats the hell out of living trapped in the heart of the labyrinth, sonny."<br>&nbsp;<br>That silenced Jack, and dampened the mood between them, as little else could have done. He and his father may have reconciled, but Jack still felt deep pangs of guilt at the way he'd trapped his father in the labyrinth.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm sorry, Jack," Silvius said as they walked through the gate--Jack handing the ticket inspector his ticket as they passed. "I could have said that a little more diplomatically."<br>&nbsp;<br>"You had every right to say it any way you wanted, Silvius."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ah, Jack, we shouldn't have to spend the rest of our lives apologizing. In our time I've been a pitiful father and you've been a lousy son. We'll just have to live with it." They'd reached the revolving doors leading out from the station into the street. "Now, what say you we step out into London and see what the night has to offer, eh?"<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As he had in his dream, Jack paused once they stood on the pavement outside. There was a fair amount of traffic on the road--mostly lorries and taxicabs--but few pedestrians.<br>&nbsp;<br>Most people would be home, glued to the wireless, waiting on news from Europe.<br>&nbsp;<br>Or Downing Street.<br>&nbsp;<br>And, as he had in his dream, Jack looked nor...</p><h2>Enterprise Logs: Star Trek</h2><p>In the annals of adventure and exploration, few names shine as brightly as those of the various vessels bearing the noble appellation of Enterprise.

I let out a strangled shout and became intimate with the gnawing water at my left elbow. Everything was so black, so dark, that I entertained a brief crazed fear that the men in this boat were the only Americans here and we would face the British ships all alone.<br><br>The coxun's fingers dug at my collar as he pulled me back to my seat. "Keep a grip on them fascines there, your honor."<br><br>"What happened?"<br><br>"Tiller's over. We're coming into the strait."<br><br>"It's the devil's own dark! How could you know to turn?"<br><br>"Wind dropped. We're in the lee of Valcour Island. We'll meet up with the American navy any minute."<br><br>While the boat hurled itself vertical on the unhappy chop, then skated sickeningly downward, I sat upon a prickle of hardwood saplings, twice as long as I was tall, stripped of every branch and tightly bound into nine- or ten-inch bundles so that they were almost tree trunks again. Five of these bundles, a great weight indeed at nearly two hundred pounds each, were strapped across the bateau's wide beam, and caused the boat to wobble and struggle horridly. Along with those, piles of evergreen boughs with warty bark and needles assaulted my legs with every shiver. What could a navy want with trees?<br><br>I strained to see into the darkness, but might as well have had a mask over my eyes. The shore of New York, on our left until now, remained invisible. Around us, Lake Champlain was deeply cloaked.<br><br>Then, out of the night, came a voice blasting on the wind. "Hands to the tops'l sheets and braces! Bring the tops'l yard abeam! Don't worry, boys, we possess the caution of youth! Other words, none!"<br><br>A huge dark mass surged out of the night, angling over my head as if I'd stepped onto a porch. Swinging in a wide arch came a thirty-foot wooden spear with four enormous triangular sails lancing the sky like great teeth. A ship's bowsprit, inches away!<br><br>"Oh!" I dropped back and kissed the water again.<br><br>Moonless night had hidden an entire ship!<br><br>The ship's sides were mounted with bundles of cut evergreens, a shaggy fence making the vessel into a giant bottlebrush. What an otherworldly sight! Camouflage?<br><br>"Hard over, Henry!" the voice again came as our bateau rowed abreast of the massive shuddering object. If the boat and the ship came together on the same wave, we'd be crushed. "Port brace, haul away! Lavengood, Thorsby, Barrette, man the bunts and clews. LaMay, show them the lines, quick, man! Barclay and Rochon, lend Hardie a hand! McCrae, your brace is fouled in the spruces. Don't hurt your hands. McCrae, do you hear me? Stephen!"<br><br>Black hull planks bumped the bateau. Bracketing his mouth, the coxun shouted up. "On deck! Heave us a painter!"<br><br>High above, a wall of angular gray sail snapped in anger. Then, <i>flap, flap...crack!</i> -- the wind filled it! The ship heeled hard, bit the water, and leaped beyond us.<br><br>"Sheet her in and stand by! Larboard, slack your sheet! Clew the tops'l! McCrae, what do you think you're doing? Rochon, I said stand by on that sheet!"<br><br>That wind-muffled voice -- did I recognize it? Or was it wishfulness after three cargo boats and two fishing smacks?<br><br>Just above me, a lantern flickered to life, dancing on the night. Its fiendish glow changed everything. Hemp ropes veined a hundred feet into the sky. Two great wooden strakes carried a huge sail that swung like a swan's wing.<br><br>From an unseen hand, a rope snaked out to the bateau, falling a foot from me. The coxun snatched it up, and twisted it to a cleat, and thus we wheeled sidewise toward the surging wooden wall.<br><br>"Is this the right ship?" I called. "I'm seeking Israel Daniel Dickenson, aboard the <i>Betsy.</i> Or is it the <i>George?</i> I've got conflicting information on the ship's name."<br><br>"We don't call our ships that way." The coxun grasped a spruce bow fixed to the ship and with superhuman power dragged the bateau close, and we skated an inch from disaster. "Get up there, man, before we're beat to splinters!"<br><br>As the bateau heaved upward, I stood and put one foot on the bateau's rail. "I'll break my neck!"<br><br>"Jump!" the coxun bellowed, "or you'll have seventy ton of sloop in your gullet!"<br><br>With one toe I pushed upward, hands scratching for a grip. Boughs rustled, my cloak and tricorn hat disappeared, and I was carried up and away, a fly clinging to a mule's black belly!<br><br>"Fend off!" the coxun called. Oars blunted the ship's sides. The boat roached away.<br><br>"Heaven help me!" With me riding her wet flank, the ship clawed forward and defied New York's western shore with her long bowsprit. Over me the hostile sail whistled. Above it, a smaller square sail crawled into a bundle and screamed on its yards. I saw all this in an instant -- lines snapped, blocks creaked, water sprayed, boughs whipped, and the yard squawked like an enraged pelican trying to snap me up.<br><br>Again, that voice. "Hands to the larboard side, for God's sake!"<br><br>A force grabbed me from above. I lost my legs. My body went straight outward on the wind. Headfirst I plunged through the bundled branches and flopped face-first upon a tilted deck. Pressing my hands to the planks, I twisted to look up.<br><br>Above me, a narrow man-shaped shadow loomed. "Get those fascines over to <i>Philadelphia</i> and mounted on. Should've been well done by midnight. Give them to Blake, he's the mate. Or Captain Rue himself. Tell them to rig their canopy and hurry! The wind's from the north!"<br><br>I rolled over and choked, "Daniel! Thank Heaven!"<br><br>The shadow's shoulders lowered some, arms out at his sides. His head tipped forward. Against the bleak sky, shoulder-length unbound hair flew wildly. "Adam Ghent, that's not you on my deck."<br><br>He offered no hand to help me up. His unglazed anger was visible even in the dark.<br><br>But wait -- the sky had lightened. As I drew to my feet and braced my legs, I could make out men around me doing feverish work, sawing, tying, hauling lines in a clutter of iron tools, round shot, wadding, tackles, blocks, piles of rope, and sponge rammers. A boy of about ten years used a bellows to keep a stone hearth glowing inside a formation of bricks. There were no uniforms. The men wore anything from muslin to buckskin, some with wool vests and tricorns or any manner of hat they could construct, and buff or black breeches. They didn't look like a navy.<br><br>I stood upon a deck that took up the front half of the ship. On my left was a snarly-looking black cannon. On my right stood a set of ladder steps leading up to another deck, a higher one, which scooped back to the stern. I could just make out more men up there, minding a huge tiller.<br><br>Through the shaggy fence of branches, I saw another ship on the water, almost as large as this one, with two quill-shaped yards jabbing the sky. Massive parallelograms of canvas carried her into a crescent of anchored vessels, a line of ghosts on a moorside vigil. All the boats wore beards made of bundled saplings.<br><br>"Who's that?" I pointed at the other sailing vessel.<br><br>"The Galley <i>Washington,"</i> Daniel answered brusquely, "moving into defensive position. Lavengood, sheet in all you can get. By the saints, if we're not up another point! Good ship!"<br><br>To our right was the crescent of anchored vessels, the smaller ones with one mast each, the larger ones, others like the <i>Washington,</i> with two. "What are all these boats?"<br><br>Daniel flopped an arm against his thigh. "Why, this, brother, is the Continental Navy! Eight fifty-four foot gunboats, a cutter, two schooners, three galleys, and the sloop you're on. And sad you'll be ever to have laid eyes upon it."<br><br>"Why are they anchored? You're not meaning to have a battle this way -- "<br><br>"The gunboats are flat-bottomed and square-rigged. They can't hope to maneuver upwind. We'll fight at anchor."<br><br>The sloop heeled fiercely and passed the ship called <i>Trumbull,</i> heading northwest, away from the place where we should be anchored.<br><br>"We'll be nicking <i>Revenge's</i> sprit at this pace," a man at the tiller commented. He had a black bandana tied onto his russet hair and arms like tree limbs, and he used lines to control the heavy tiller with tackles.<br><br>"We'll make anchor with one more tack," Daniel said to him, "and come to our position on the broad reach."<br><br>"It'll have to be handy."<br><br>"Say it again, Henry, that the Fates hear you over the wind."<br><br>In defiance the wind screamed away his words. We cut past four of the gunboats, with their single masts drawing circles on the sky, sails bundled upon slanted yards. At the south of the bay, another sailing ship maneuvered in the cup of the crescent. "Who's that one?" I asked.<br><br><i>"Royal Savage.</i> Quiet, Adam. Ready about! Keep a firm turn on the pins, men. Let's not have a repeat of that ugly little episode yesterday. Let go your jib sheets! Helm over, Henry!"<br><br>At the tiller, Henry and two other men suddenly shifted from one side of the ship to the other. Only now, as their cold-reddened toes squeaked on the wet deck, did I realize they were bare of foot. Some had tied cloth about their feet, but these men were wearing rags.<br><br>The ship's narrow body shuddered, came to an even keel, rocked briefly on the chop. The long bowsprit bit into the north wind.<br><br>"Starboard, haul away your jib sheets!"<br><br>The crew's heads disappeared and their elbows pummeled the air. The four triangular sails on the bowsprit whacked like wild horses, making a drumming sound, but the bow came around. The ship turned on a pin, the sails snapped full, and instantly we were faced back east, stabbing the bowsprit at Valcour Island.<br><br>"Prepare to haul that gaff down by hand," Daniel ordered. "The sail'll fight you. Hands to the cathead!" When some men looked confused, he added, "Show 'em, Henry. Barrette, man the aft anchor. Men, it's critical both anchors drop at the same time, understood?"<br><br>The man called Barrette smiled ruggedly and said, "I can forge 'em, Daniel. Bet I can drop 'em too!"<br><br>"Good man," Daniel said. "Otherwise we'll end up with our stern swung south. We must be broadside to the enemy. We're passing <i>Connecticut --</i> as we come abeam of <i>New York,</i> we'll strike sail and drop anchor. Almost there...wait...wait...ready...aft anchor, drop! Take in and make fast -- quick, quick! Peak and throat halyards, lower away! Forward anchor, drop! Downhauls, haul away!"<br><br>I had only half a clue what he was up to, but the ship seemed to know. The big sail and the triangles fell into linenfolds, iron rings screaming on the cables, and the wind raced by without us. The anchor lines snapped with us between them. We were anchored in position, with a galley before us and the crescent of other boats behind, strapped across the bay between Valcour Island and the shoreline of New York.<br><br>Daniel faced his crew down on the gun deck. "Cockbill the tops'l yard. Clear for action, boys, ready every gun. Get that canopy up and the pine boughs on top of it! Get it over the forward guns if you can. Handily now! Wind's from the north!"<br><br>Around us, shivering, the men scratched to their work.<br><br>Eyes ferocious, lips flat, Daniel Dickenson finally turned to give me the attention he had avoided. "Come for last rites?"<br><br>"I brought a parcel from your mother." Rather clumsily, I climbed the nearly vertical steps, holding ropes that were fastened in the fashion of a handrail. Still Daniel had to clasp my arm and pull me to the upper deck. Bracing my legs, I fished through my coat, hoping the ride upon the ship's flank had not claimed the bundle. Good, here it was.<br><br>He did not take it. "You came from Connecticut to bring mail?"<br><br>My brother-in-law leered at me through a flop of brown hair beating his cheekbone. I scarcely recognized him. Four months ago he had gone to answer the call for experienced sailors and wrights, rosy-cheeked and well-clothed, umber hair bound at the back of his neck like a gentleman. The wraith before me was gaunt, waistcoat ratty, breeches patched, day coat completely missing. His hair was long and lusterless, gone dark as oak bark. Scratched, bare arms protruded from torn sleeves as if someone had dressed a cadaver. Upon his feet were Indian moccasins, worn to parchment.<br><br>"What happened to you?" I whispered.<br><br>"Camp fever," he said. "Typhoid, malaria, and four months round-the-clock toil to construct these gunboats and galleys, launching a ne...</p><h2>Nikki on the Line</h2><p><b>Nikki wants to be a basketball star... but between school stress, friend drama, and babysitting woes, will she be able to make it on her new team? </b><b><b>Judy Blume meets Mike Lupica in this pitch-perfect, action-packed, and funny novel.<br><br></b></b> Thirteen-year-old Nikki Doyle's dreams of becoming a basketball great feel within reach when she's selected to play on an elite-level club team.

It is also the story of one man&#39;s dream. It is a story from the deepest past, and yet it is a story as close to us as the wind. The narrative of the epic is set in the period around 1250BC, shortly before the Mycenaean civilization of the Mediterranean began to crumble and city states such as Thebes, Knossus and Tiryns fell victim to a period when settled life broke down. It took centuries to rebuild the glory that had been lost. It was a true dark age, but through travelling storytellers and the oral tradition, the stories of old heroes and gods, among them tales of the siege of Troy, were kept alive. For centuries scholars believed that both the place depicted and the events in the epic were mere fables. It took an unscholarly German indigo salesman to make the connection between the text of The Iliad, as written down by Homer, and the truth. He discovered a site of an ancient city that could have been the real Troy.</p><p></p><h2>Spyplane: The U-2 History Declassified</h2><p>The inner workings and heavily censored history of Lockheed&#39;s dynamic U-2 spyplane are revealed in this informative design, development and operational history from 1954.

A. Brannen Series)</h2><p>Scholars and historians offer several theories for the crippling losses suffered by the American Expeditionary Forces on the battlefields of World War I: inexperience, poor leadership, hasty expansion of duties, and others. But until now, most of these studies have focused at the division level or higher. Now, with To the Limit of Endurance, Peter F. Owen offers a tautly worded, historically rigorous, and intensely human survey of the agonizing burden shouldered by the Second Battalion of the Sixth Regiment of U.S. Marines from its formation in Quantico, Virginia, in 1917 until the cessation of hostilities in November of the following year. In places like Belleau Wood and Soissons, these young men, led by dedicated officers, died in staggering numbers&#x2014;primarily because of the outmoded tactics they had learned. Owen shows how the battalion regrouped after these campaigns, however, and embarked on a period of intense retraining. By the time of the closing weeks of the war, the adjustments they had made allowed them to mold themselves into a coldly efficient military machine. Drawing on a treasure trove of surviving first-hand accounts, Owen expertly combines these individual observations with military records and archival sources to create a mosaic that provides not only a case study of how one organization grappled with transformation but also a tightly focused, ground-level view of the lives&#x2014;and deaths&#x2014;of these courageous American military men. The grueling, ultimately triumphant odyssey of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Marines will appeal to military historians, professional soldiers, and interested general readers.</p><p>PETER F.

L. Mencken (Library of Religious Biography)</h2><p><i>Recounts a famously outspoken agnostic's surprising relationship with Christianity</i><br><br> H. L. Mencken (1880&#x2013;1956) was a reporter, literary critic, editor, author&#x2014;and a famous American agnostic. From his role in the Scopes Trial to his advocacy of science and reason in public life, Mencken is generally regarded as one of the fiercest critics of Christianity in his day.<br><br> In this biography D. G. Hart presents a provocative, iconoclastic perspective on Mencken's life. Even as Mencken vividly debunked American religious ideals, says Hart, it was Christianity that largely framed his ideas, career, and fame.

So start reading, and prepare to join Ross Thomas&#x2019;s legions of admiring fans.<br><b>Out on the Rim</b><br><b>CHAPTER 1</b>At three in the afternoon they summoned Booth Stallings, the terrorism expert, to the library in the foundation's seven-story building just east of Dupont Circle on Massachusetts Avenue and fired him over a glass of fairly good Spanish sherry. It was the Ides of March, which fell on a Saturday in 1986, and exactly two months after Booth Stallings' sixtieth birthday.The firing was done without any qualms that Stallings could detect by Douglas House, the foundation's thirty-five-year-old executive director. House did it politely, of course, with no trace of acrimony, and with about the same amount of regret he might use if calling the <i>Washington Post</i> circulation department to put a vacation stop on his home delivery.It was the foundation's fifty-one-year-old chairman, Frank Tomguy, who administered the pro forma ego massage while wearing an apologetic, even deferential air and one of his $1,100 three-piece suits. Tomguy went on and on about severe budgetary restrictions and then turned to the quality of Booth Stallings' work, which he swore had been brilliant. No question. Absolutely, totally brilliant.Tomguy's massage completed, Douglas House spoke of money. There would be three months' severance pay in lieu of notice and thefoundation would keep Stallings' health insurance in force for six months. There was no talk of pension because the terrorism expert had been with the foundation only eighteen months, although that was three months longer than he had ever stuck with any other job.As the dry talk continued, Stallings lost interest and let his eyes wander around the black walnut paneled library, presumably for the last time. He eventually noticed the lengthening silence. Now that they've canned you so nicely and apologized so handsomely, you're expected to say something appropriate. So he said the only thing that came to mind. "I used to live here, you know."It wasn't what Douglas House had expected and he shifted uneasily in his leather wingback chair, as if apprehensive that Stallings had launched into some kind of sentimental, even mawkish goodbye. But Tomguy, the chairman, seemed to know better. He smiled and asked the obvious question. "Where's here, Booth?""Right here," Stallings said with a small encompassing gesture. "Before the foundation built this place in--what? seventy-two?--there used to be a big old four-story red sandstone mansion that got cut up into apartments during the war." He glanced at Douglas House. "World War II." House nodded."I rented the third floor one in February of sixty-one," Stallings went on. "Partly because I could walk to work and partly because of the address--1776 Massachusetts Avenue." His lips stretched into what may or may not have been a small smile. "A patriot's address."Tomguy cleared his throat. "That walk was to the White House then, wasn't it, Booth? And you were back from Africa or some such.""I was just back from Stanleyville and the walk was to the old Executive Office Building, which wasn't the White House then and still isn't.""Heady times, those," Douglas House said, apparently just to be saying something.Stallings examined House briefly, not blaming the executive director for having been ten years old in 1961. "Ancient history," he saidand turned back to Tomguy. "What happens to my Angola survey?"Tomguy had a square and too honest pink face and not very much gray-blond hair whose sparseness he wisely made no attempt to conceal. From behind rimless bifocals, a pair of wet brown eyes, slightly popped, stared out at the world's perfidy, as if in chronic amazement. Still, it was a face to inspire confidence, what with its stairstep chin, purselike mouth and an aggressive Roman nose that was altogether reassuring. A perfect banker's face, Stallings thought, if only it could dissemble successfully, which it seemed incapable of doing.The question about the Angola survey made Tomguy turn to the executive director for guidance. With a slight smile that could have meant anything, Douglas House gazed steadily at Stallings who prepared himself for the inevitable evasions."We ran it by some people downtown," House said, the smile still in place, the gray eyes indifferent.Stallings returned the smile. "Did you now? What people? The Georgetown boys? The folks in the Building? Maybe some of the Langley laddies? Did everybody love it?""They all thought it could use a bit of restructuring.""That means they don't mind my calling Savimbi brilliant, but they'd just as soon I didn't call him a brilliant back-slid Maoist crook, which they damn well know he is."Tomguy, the prudent conciliator, offered soothing noises. It's still scheduled for summer publication, Booth. Our lead item.""Restructured though.""Edited," House said.Stallings shrugged and rose. "Then take my name off it." He gave the handsome library another last glance. "Thanks for the drink."Tomguy rose quickly, right hand outstretched. Stallings took it without hesitation. "Sorry it had to wind up like this, Booth.""Are you?" Stallings said. "I'm not."He nodded at the still seated Douglas House, turned and headed for the door, a tall lanky man who used a kind of gliding lope for awalk. He wore a thatch of short ragged gray hair that hugged his head like an old cap. Under it the world was presented with a face so seamed and weathered that many looked twice, not sure whether it was ugly or handsome and, finding it neither, settled on different.After Booth Stallings had gone, Tomguy watched silently as House rose, went to the telephone and punched a local number from memory. It rang only once before being answered. "It's done," House said into the phone. "He just left." House listened to either a question or a comment, replied, "Right," hung up and turned to Tomguy."They're all extremely grateful," House said. "I'm quoting."Tomguy nodded, his expression sour. "They fucking well better be."&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Booth Stallings sat on his favorite bench at the north end of Dupont Circle, sipping from a half-pint of Smirnoff 80 proof that came disguised in the de rigueur brown paper sack. One bench over, a pretty young mother took yet another apprehensive look at him and quickly stuck her twin eighteen-month-old sons back down into their elaborate top-of-the-line stroller where they would ride home facing each other.Stallings tried a reassuring smile that was obviously a failure because the mother shot him another black look, gave the stroller a shove and hurried away. The forward-facing twin started to bawl. The backward-facing one burbled merrily and waved at Stallings who toasted him with the half-pint of vodka. He had another sip and tucked the bottle down into a pocket of the eight-year-old suede jacket he had bought cheaply in Istanbul.It was then that Stallings noticed the weather and the time. It had grown chilly and was almost dusk, which presented the problem of what he should do with the Saturday night that stretched out before him like a slice of infinity.Stallings' choices were limited. He could spend the evening alone with a book or a bottle in his sublet apartment on ConnecticutAvenue across from the zoo, or he could drop in uninvited, unexpected and possibly unwelcome on either his Georgetown daughter or the one who lived in Cleveland Park.In Georgetown the food promised to be fancier but the dinner guests (six at least on Saturday night) would spend the evening handicapping the 1988 presidential race, divining signs and portents from the same printed entrails that each had studied during the past week in the <i>Post</i> and the <i>Times</i> and whatever else they had happened to read.Booth Stallings, child of the Depression, had never really much cared who was President after Roosevelt died. He had voted only once, and that was back in 1948 when, at twenty-two, he lightheartedly had marked his ballot for Henry Agard Wallace. Whenever he thought of it now, which was seldom, he congratulated himself on the youthful folly.Stallings had a final sip from the vodka bottle, rose from the bench and went in search of a pay phone, having decided to call his Cleveland Park daughter. He found a bank of pay phones near the Peoples Drugstore on the southwest arc of Dupont Circle. Using the only one that hadn't been ravaged, he called the thirty-three-year-old Lydia who had married Howard Mott shortly before he left the Justice Department in 1980 to specialize in the defense of wealthy white-collar criminals. Mott liked to describe his practice as a growth industry. After two slow years, Mott was growing wealthy himself.When Stallings' Cleveland Park daughter answered the phone, he said, "What's for dinner?"Lydia Mott gasped. "Oh my God, it's all over town!""What?""You got fired. You drunk yet?""Not yet, and all over town means Joanna, right?" Joanna was Stallings' thirty-five-year-old Georgetown daughter. She had married a car wax heir whose wealth and political leanings had won him anappointment to the upper reaches of the State Department. Stallings sometimes thought of his son-in-law as Neal the Know-nothing."She's called three times," Lydia Mott said."What for?""Because she made this tentative dinner date for you. It's about a job and he wants you to have dinner with him around seven-thirty at the Montpelier Room in the Madison and, Jesus, that'll set him back a few bucks, won't it?""Lydia," a patient Stallings said. "Who's he?""Right. That is kind of pertinent. Well, it's one Harry Crites.""The poet.""Poet?""He gets published.""Yeah, but what does he <i>do?"</i>Stallings hesitated. "I'm not quite sure. Anymore."...</p><h2>Days of Blood and Starlight: The Sunday Times Bestseller.

Kevin Boutote, Recording Engineer.</p></p><p>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo. His work has been translated into more than fifty languages, and the most recent of his many international honors is the Jerusalem Prize, whose previous recipients include J. M. Coetzee, Milan Kundera, and V. S. Naipaul.From July of his sophomore year in college until the following January, all Tsukuru Tazaki could think about was dying. He turned twenty during this time, but this special watershed&#x2014;becoming an adult&#x2014;meant nothing. Taking his own life seemed the most natural solution, and even now he couldn&#x2019;t say why he hadn&#x2019;t taken this final step. Crossing that threshold between life and&nbsp;death would have been easier than swallowing down a slick, raw egg.<br><br> Perhaps he didn&#x2019;t commit suicide then because he couldn&#x2019;t conceive of a method that fit the pure and intense feelings he had toward death. But method was beside the point. If there had been a door within reach that led straight to death, he wouldn&#x2019;t have hesitated to push it open, without a second thought, as if it were just a part of ordinary life. For better or for worse, though, there was no such door nearby.<br><br> &nbsp;<br> I really should have died then, Tsukuru often told himself. Then this world, the one in the here and now, wouldn&#x2019;t exist. It was a captivating, bewitching thought. The present world wouldn&#x2019;t exist, and reality would no longer be real. As far as this world was concerned, he would simply no longer exist&#x2014;just as this world would no longer exist for him.<br><br> At the same time, Tsukuru couldn&#x2019;t fathom why he had reached this point, where he was teetering over the precipice. There was an actual event that had led him to this place&#x2014;this he knew all too well&#x2014;but why should death have such a hold over him, enveloping him in&nbsp;its embrace for nearly half a year? Envelop&#x2014;the word expressed it precisely. Like Jonah in the belly of the whale, Tsukuru had fallen into the bowels of death, one untold day after another, lost in a dark, stagnant void.<br><br>It was as if he were sleepwalking through life, as if&nbsp;he had already died but not yet noticed it. When the sun rose, so would Tsukuru&#x2014;he&#x2019;d brush his teeth, throw on whatever clothes were at hand, ride the train to college, and take notes in class. Like a person in a storm desperately grasping at a lamppost, he clung to this daily routine. He only spoke to people when necessary, and after school, he would return to his solitary apartment, sit on the floor, lean back against the wall, and ponder death and the failures of his life. Before him lay a huge, dark&nbsp;abyss that ran straight through to the earth&#x2019;s core. All he could see was a thick cloud of nothingness swirling around him; all he could hear was a profound silence squeezing his eardrums.<br><br>When he wasn&#x2019;t thinking about death, his mind was blank. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to keep from thinking. He didn&#x2019;t read any newspapers, didn&#x2019;t listen to music, and had&nbsp;no sexual desire to speak of. Events occurring in the outside world were, to him, inconsequential. When he grew tired of his room, he wandered aimlessly around the neighborhood or went to the station, where he sat on a bench and watched the trains arriving and departing, over and over again.<br><br> He took a shower every morning, shampooed his hair well, and did the laundry twice a week. Cleanliness was another one of his pillars: laundry, bathing, and teeth brushing. He barely noticed what he ate. He had lunch at the college cafeteria, but other than&nbsp;that, he hardly consumed a decent meal. When he felt hungry he stopped by the local supermarket and bought an apple or some vegetables. Sometimes he ate plain bread, washing it down with milk straight from the carton. &nbsp;When it was time to sleep, he&#x2019;d gulp down a glass of whiskey as if it were a dose of medicine. Luckily he wasn&#x2019;t much of a drinker, and a small dose of alcohol was all it took to send him off to sleep. He never&nbsp;dreamed. But even if he had dreamed, even if dreamlike images arose from the edges of his mind, they would have found nowhere to perch on the slippery slopes of his consciousness, instead quickly sliding off, down into the void.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The reason why death had such a hold on Tsukuru Tazaki was clear. One day his four closest friends, the friends he&#x2019;d known for a long time, announced that they did not want to see him, or talk with him, ever again. It was a sudden, decisive declaration, with no room for compromise. They gave no explanation, not a word, for this harsh pronouncement. And Tsukuru didn&#x2019;t dare ask.<br><br> He&#x2019;d been friends with the four of them since high school, though when they cut him off, Tsukuru had already left his hometown and was attending college in Tokyo. So being banished didn&#x2019;t have any immediate negative effects on his daily routine&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t like there would be awkward moments when he&#x2019;d run into them on the street. But that was just quibbling. The&nbsp;pain he felt was, if anything, more intense, and weighed down on him even more greatly because of the physical distance. Alienation and loneliness became a cable that stretched hundreds of miles long, pulled to the breaking&nbsp;point by a gigantic winch. And through that taut line, day and night, he received indecipherable messages. Like a gale blowing between trees, those messages varied in strength as they reached him in fragments, stinging his ears.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The five of them had been classmates at a public high school in the suburbs of Nagoya. Three boys, and two girls. During summer vacation of their freshman year, they all did some volunteer work together and became friends. Even after freshman year, when they were in different classes, they remained a close-knit group. The volunteer work that had brought them together had been part of a social studies summer assignment, but even after it ended, they chose to volunteer as a group.<br><br> Besides the volunteer work, they went hiking together on holidays, played tennis, swam at the Chita Peninsula, or got together at one of their houses to study for tests. Or else&#x2014;and this was what they did most often&#x2014;they just hung out someplace, and talked for hours.&nbsp; It wasn&#x2019;t like they showed up with a topic in mind&#x2014;they just never ran out of things to talk about.<br><br>Pure chance had brought them together. There were several volunteer opportunities they could have chosen from, but the one they all chose, independently, was&nbsp;an after-school tutoring program for elementary school kids (most of whom were children who refused to go to school). The program was run by a Catholic church, and of the thirty-five students in their high school class, the five of them were the only ones who selected it. To start, they participated in a three-day summer camp outside Nagoya, and got to be good friends with the children.<br><br> Whenever they took a break, the five of them gathered to talk. They got to know each other better, sharing their ideas and opening up about their dreams, as well as their problems. And when the summer camp was over, each one of them felt they were in the right place, where they needed to be, with the perfect companions. A unique sense of harmony developed between them&#x2014;each one needed the other four and, in turn, shared the sense that they too were needed. The whole convergence was like a lucky but entirely accidental chemical fusion, something that could only happen&nbsp;once. You might gather the same materials and make identical preparations, but you would never be able to duplicate the result.<br><br>After the initial volunteer period, they spent about two weekends a month at the after-school program, teaching the kids, reading to them, playing with them. They mowed the lawn, painted the building, and repaired playground equipment. They continued this&nbsp;work for the next two years, until they graduated from high school.<br><br>The only source of tension among them was the uneven number&#x2014;the fact that their group was comprised of three boys and two girls. If two of the boys and two of the girls became couples, the remaining boy would be left out. That possibility must have always been hanging over their heads like a small, thick, lenticular cloud. But it never happened, nor did it even seem a likely possibility.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps coincidentally, all five of them were from suburban, upper-middle-class families. Their parents were baby boomers; their fathers were all professionals. Their parents spared no expense when it came to their children&#x2019;s education. On the surface, at least, their families were peaceful, and stable. None of their parents got divorced, and most of them had stay-at-home mothers. Their high school emphasized academics, and their grades were uniformly good. Overall there were far more similarities than differences in their everyday environments.<br><br> And aside from Tsukuru Tazaki, they had another small, coincidental point in common: their last names all contained a color. The two boys&#x2019; last names were&nbsp;Akamatsu&#x2014;which means&nbsp; &#x201c;red pine&#x201d;&#x2014;and Oumi&#x2014;&#x201c;blue sea&#x201d;; the girls&#x2019; family names were Shirane&#x2014;&#x201c;white root&#x201d;&#x2014;and Kurono&#x2014;&#x201c;black field.&#x201d; Tazaki was the only last name that did not have a color in its meaning. From the very beginning this fact made him feel a little bit left out. Of course, whether or not you had a color as part of your name had nothing to do with your personality. Tsukuru understood this. But still, it disappointed him, and he surprised himself by feeling hurt. Soon,&nbsp;the other four friends began to use nicknames: the boys were called Aka (red) and Ao (blue); and the girls were Shiro (white) and Kuro (black). But he just remained Tsukuru. How great it would be, he often thought, if I had a color in my name too. Then everything would be perfect.<br><br> Aka was the one with the best grades. He never seemed to study hard, yet was at the top of his class in every subject. He never bragged about his grades, however, and preferred to cautiously stay in the background, almost as if he were embarrassed to be so smart. But&nbsp;as often is the case with short people&#x2014;he never grew past five foot three&#x2014;once he made up his mind about something, no matter how trivial it might be, he never backed down. And he was bothered by illogical rules and by teachers who couldn&#x2019;t meet his exacting standards. He hated to lose; whenever he lost a tennis match, it put him in a bad mood. He didn&#x2019;t act out, or&nbsp;pout&#x2014;instead, he just became unusually quiet. The other four friends found his short temper amusing and often teased him about it. Eventually Aka would always break down and laugh along with them. His father was a professor of economics at Nagoya University.<br><br>Ao was impressively built, with wide shoulders and a barrel chest, as well as a broad forehead, a generous mouth, and an imposing nose. He was a forward on the rugby team, and in his senior year he was elected team captain. He really hustled on the field and was constantly getting cuts and bruises. He wasn&#x2019;t good&nbsp;at buckling down and studying, but he was a cheerful person and enormously popular among his classmates. He always looked people straight in the eye, spoke in a clear, strong voice, and had an amazing appetite, seeming to enjoy everything set down in front of him. He also had a quick recall of people&#x2019;s names and faces, and seldom said anything bad about anyone else. He was&nbsp;a good listener and a born leader. Tsukuru could never forget the way he&#x2019;d gather his team around him before a match to give them a pep talk.<br><br> &#x201c;Listen up!&#x201d; Ao would bellow. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to win. The only question is how and by how much. Losing is not an option for us. You hear me? Losing is not an option!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not an option!&#x201d; the team would shout, before rushing out onto the field.<br><br>Not that their high school rugby team was all that&nbsp;good. Ao was clever and extremely athletic, but the team itself was mediocre. When they went up against teams from private schools, where players had been recruited from all over the country on athletic scholarships, Ao&#x2019;s team usually lost. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d tell his friends, &#x201c;is the will to win. In the real world we can&#x2019;t always win. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And sometimes you get rained out,&#x201d; Kuro remarked, with typical sarcasm.<br><br>Ao shook his head sadly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re confusing rugby with baseball or tennis. Rugby&#x2019;s never postponed on account of rain.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You play even when it&#x2019;s raining?&#x201d; Shiro asked, surprised. Shiro knew next to nothing about &nbsp;sports, and had zero interest in them.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Aka said seriously. &#x201c;Rugby matches are never canceled. No matter how hard it rains. That&#x2019;s why every year you get a lot of players who drown during matches.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My God, that&#x2019;s awful!&#x201d; Shiro said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly. He&#x2019;s joking,&#x201d; Kuro said, in a slightly disgusted tone.<br><br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; Ao went on, &#x201c;my point is that if you&#x2019;re an athlete you have to learn how to be a good loser.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You certainly get a lot of practice with that every day,&#x201d; Kuro said.<br><br>Shiro was tall and slim, with a model&#x2019;s body and&nbsp;the graceful features of a traditional Japanese doll. Her long hair was a silky, lustrous black. Most people who passed her on the street would turn around for a second look, but she seemed to find her beauty embarrassing. She was a serious person, who above all else disliked drawing attention to herself. She was also a wonderful, skilled pianist, though she would never play for someone she didn&#x2019;t know. She seemed happiest while teaching piano to children in an after-school program. During these lessons, Shiro looked completely relaxed, more relaxed than Tsukuru saw her at any other&nbsp; time. Several of the children, Shiro said, might not be good at regular schoolwork, but they had a natural talent for music and it would be a shame to not develop it. The school only had an old upright piano, almost an antique, so the five of them started a fund-raising drive to buy a new one. They worked part-time during summer vacation, and persuaded a company that made musical instruments to help them out. In the spring of their senior year, their hard work finally paid off, resulting in the purchase of a grand piano for the school. Their campaign caught people&#x2019;s attention and was even featured in a newspaper.<br><br>Shiro was usually quiet, but she loved animals so&nbsp;much that when a conversation turned to dogs and cats, her face lit up and the words would cascade out from her. Her dream was to become a veterinarian, though Tsukuru couldn&#x2019;t picture her with a scalpel, slicing open the belly of a Labrador retriever, or sticking her hand&nbsp;up the anus of a horse. If she went to vet school, that&#x2019;s exactly the kind of training she&#x2019;d have to do. Her father ran an ob-gyn clinic in Nagoya.<br><br>Kuro wasn&#x2019;t beautiful, but she was eager and charming and always curious. She was large-boned and full-bodied, and already had a well-developed bust by the time she was sixteen. She was independent and tough, with a mind as quick as her tongue. She did well in humanities subjects, but was hopeless at math and physics. Her father ran an accounting firm in Nagoya, but there was no way she would ever be able to help out. Tsukuru often helped her with her math homework. She could be sarcastic but had a unique, refreshing sense of humor, and he found talking with her fun and stimulating. She was a great reader, too, and always had a book under her arm.<br><br> Shiro and Kuro had been in the same class in junior high and knew each other well, even before the five of them became friends. To see them together was a...</p><h2>The Ultimate Diabetes Cookbook</h2><p><b>Here at last is a diabetes cookbook with a difference: delicious recipes designed for people with diabetes as well as additional health complications. Award-winning cookbook author Carol Gelles, herself a Type II/Adult -Onset diabetic, has written the first cookbook to address the full range of dietary needs of people with diabetes.</b><br><br><i>The Ultimate Diabetes Cookbook</i> features recipes tailored for diabetic diets and the additional dietary restrictions for people with complications from diabetes. For example, someone with heart disease as well as diabetes can use the book to turn a basic recipe into one that is also low-fat/low-cholesteral. People with high blood pressure and diabetes will find low-sodium versions of most recipes. For kidney patients, there are numerous low-protein variations of basic recipes. All the recipes are suitable for the simple diabetic diet.

It shouldn&#x2019;t have mattered since the steamship was only chartered for a<b> </b>languid excursion from Manhattan to Long Island Sound. But a fire erupted minutes into the trip, forcing hundreds of terrified passengers into the water. By the time the captain found a safe shore for landing, 1,021 had perished. It was New York&#x2019;s deadliest tragedy prior to September 11, 2001.<br><br>The only book available on this compelling chapter in the city&#x2019;s history, <i>Ship Ablaze</i> draws on firsthand accounts to examine why the death toll was so high, how the city responded, and why this event failed to achieve the infamy of the <i>Titanic</i>&#x2019;s 1912 demise or the<b> </b>1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Masterfully capturing both the horror of the event and heroism of men, women, and children who faced crumbling life jackets and inaccessible lifeboats as the inferno quickly spread, historian Edward T.

Robert Anton Wilson, the &#34;last Scientific shaman of our age&#34; provides us with a guide to illumination in this series of three books that are one book. Each volume here collected is a different view of the same world, a ride through the most radical theories of modern physics. Many characters from the Illuminatus! Trilogy reappear, including Simon Moon and the midget Markoff Chaney. They all take slightly different forms, except for Chaney, who appears as the ever constant Random Factor. And when Ulyses return to Ithyca, we get a peak at what Wilson&#39;s imagination is capable of. The book may be slightly perverse. But then, he&#39;s writing about the state of the human race. I assume that it is only Wilson&#39;s positivity that keeps him from writing us all into a novel that would make Sade cringe. The point here is to enjoy, observe, and learn. Readers of Illuminatus! will certainly enjoy this book. Moralists, of course, will weep in their beds. But that&#39;s the best part of all...</p><p></p><h2>The Creation of Cloah Sark</h2><p>After losing one boat in the West Indies, Johnny Clougher returned to New Zealand on Christmas Eve, 1968, with no assets, trade skills or even any knowledge of boat-building.

Agriculture quickly followed the railroads, making way for Kansas wheat and Colorado sugar beets and Washington apples. With this new agriculture came an unavoidable need for harvest workers&#x2014;for hands to pick the apples, cotton, oranges, and hops; to pull and top the sugar beets; to fill the trays with raisin grapes and apricots; to stack the wheat bundles in shocks to be pitched into the maw of the threshing machine. These were not the year-round hired hands but transients who would show up to harvest the crop and then leave when the work was finished. &nbsp;Variously called bindlestiffs, fruit tramps, hoboes, and bums, these men&#x2014;and women and children&#x2014;were vital to the creation of the West and its economy. Amazingly, it is an aspect of Western history that has never been told. In <i>Hoboes: Bindlestiffs, Fruit Tramps, and the Harvesting of the West</i>, the award-winning historian Mark Wyman beautifully captures the lives of these workers. Exhaustively researched and highly original, this narrative history is a detailed, deeply sympathetic portrait of the lives of these hoboes, as well as a fresh look at the settling and development of the American West.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, May 2010: </strong> Hoboes. The word calls images of the dusty downtrodden: a subterranean vagabond society communicating through secret symbols and riding rails from one terminus to another; the iconic hobo scruff and shouldered bindle stick. Mark Wyman's fascinating, deeply researched, and groundbreaking <em>Hoboes </em>strips away the rust from hobo history, revealing the intricate, multi-ethnic tapestry that hung in the background of the Old West--and in many ways drove its economy. From bindlestiffs and beeters to <em>betabeleros </em>and <em>buranketto </em>boys (not to mention gasoline tramps and apple glommers) <em>Hoboes </em>documents the lives, travails, and impact of the itinerant workers who sought opportunity--most often short-lived at best--as the railroads pushed the frontier into the memory of the modern United States. <em>--Jon Foro</em>A distinguished professor of&nbsp;history, emeritus, at Illinois State University, Mark Wyman has written several books on immigration and the American West. He lives in Normal, Illinois, with his wife Eva.</p><h2>The People in the Trees</h2><p>In 1950, a young doctor, Norton Perina, signs on with the anthropologist Paul Tallent for an expedition to the remote island of Ivu&#39;ivu in search of a rumored lost tribe. They succeed, finding not only that tribe but also a group of forest dwellers they dub &#34;&#34;The Dreamers,&#34;&#34; who turn out to be fantastically long-lived but progressively more senile. Perina suspects the source of their longevity is a hard-to-find turtle; unable to resist the possibility of eternal life, he kills one and smuggles some meat back to the States. He proves his thesis, earning worldwide fame, but he soon discovers that its miraculous property comes at a terrible price. As things quickly spiral out of his control, his own demons take hold, with devastating consequences.</p><p>Hanya Yanagihara is a former member of the Vintage publicity department, and currently an editor-at-large at Conde Nast Traveler.

By which I mean that the town, as I remember it, was exceptional only for its very lack of distinguishing details. There were silos, and red barns (most of the residents were farmers), and general stores, and churches, and ministers and doctors and teachers and men and women and children: an outline for an American society, but one with no flourishes, no decoration, no accessories. There were a few drunks, and a resident madman, and dogs and cats, and a county fair that was held in tandem with Locust, an incorporated town a few miles to the west that no longer exists. The townspeople--there were eighteen hundred of us--were born, and went to school, and did chores, and became farmers, and married Lindonites, and began families of their own. When you saw someone in the street, you&#x2019;d nod to him or, if you were a man, pull down the brim of your hat a bit. The seasons changed, the tobacco and corn grew and were harvested. That was Lindon.<br><br>There were four of us in the family: my father, my mother, and Owen and me.<b> (1)</b>&nbsp;We lived on a hundred acres of land, in a sagging house whose only notable characteristic was a massive, once-grand central staircase that long before had been transformed by generations of termites into a lacy ruin.<br><br>About a mile behind the house ran a curvy creek, too small and slow and behaviorally inconsistent to warrant a proper name. Every March and April, after the winter thaw, it would surpass its limitations and become a proper river, swollen and aggressive with gallons of melted snow and spring rain. During those months, the creek&#x2019;s very nature changed. It became merciless and purposeful, and seized from its outgrown banks tiny, starry bloodroot blossoms and wild thyme by their roots and whisked them downstream, where they were abandoned in the thicket of a dam someone unknown had built long ago. Minnows, the creek&#x2019;s year-round inhabitants, fought upstream and drowned. For that one season, the creek had a voice: an outraged roar of rushing water, of power, and that narrow tributary, normally so placid and characterless, became during those months something frightening and unpredictable, and we were warned to keep away.<br><br>But in the heat of the summer months, the creek--which didn&#x2019;t originate at our property but rather at the Muellers&#x2019;, who lived about five miles to the east--dried once again to a meek trickle, timorously creeping its way past our farm. The air above it would be noisy with clouds of buzzing mosquitoes and dragonflies, and leeches would suck along its soft silty bottom. We used to go fishing there, and swimming, and afterward would climb back up the low hill to our house, scratching at the mosquito welts on our arms and legs until they became furry with old skin and new blood.<br><br>My father never ventured down to the creek, but my mother used to like to sit on the grass and watch the water lick over her ankles. When we were very young, we would call out to her--Look at us!--and she would lift her head dreamily and wave, though she was just as likely to wave at us as she was to wave at, say, a nearby oak sapling. (Our mother&#x2019;s sight was fine, but she often behaved as a blind person would; she moved through the world as a sleepwalker.) By the time Owen and I were seven or eight or so (at any rate, too young to have become disenchanted with her), she had become an object of at first pity and, soon after, of fun. We&#x2019;d wave at her, sitting on the bank, her arms crossed under her knees, and then, as she was waving back at us (with her whole arm rather than simply her hand, like a clump of seaweed listing underwater), we&#x2019;d turn away, talk loudly to each other, pretend not to see her. Later, over dinner, when she&#x2019;d ask what we&#x2019;d done at the creek, we&#x2019;d act astonished, perplexed. The creek? But we hadn&#x2019;t been there! We were playing in the fields all day.<br><br>&#x201c;But I saw you there,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say.<br><br>No, we&#x2019;d tell her in unison, shaking our heads. It must have been two other boys. Two other boys who looked just like us.<br><br>&#x201c;But--&#x201d; she&#x2019;d begin, and her face would seize for a moment in confusion before clearing. &#x201c;It must have been,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say uncertainly, and look down at her plate.<br><br>This exchange occurred several times a month. It was a game for us, but an unsettling one. Was our mother playing along? But the look that crossed her face--of real worry, of fear that she was, as we said back then, not right, that she was unable to trust or believe her sight or memory--seemed too real, too spontaneous. We chose to believe that she was acting, for the alternative, that she was mad or, worse, genuinely moronic, was too frightening to contemplate seriously. Later, in our room, Owen and I would imitate her (&#x201c;But--but--but--it was you!&#x201d;) and laugh, but afterward, lying in our beds, silent, considering the game&#x2019;s implications, we were troubled. We were young, but we both knew (from books, from our peers) what a mother was expected to do--to chastise, to teach, to instruct, to discipline if necessary--and furthermore, we both knew our mother was not fit for those tasks. What, we wondered, would we grow up to become under such a woman? Why was she so incapable? We treated her like most boys would treat small animals: kindly when we were feeling happy and generous, cruelly when we were not. It was intoxicating to know we had the power to make her shoulders relax, to make her lips part in an uncertain smile, and yet also to make her turn her face down, to make her rub her palm quickly against her leg, which she did when she was nervous or unhappy or confused. Despite our concerns, we never spoke of them aloud; the only discussions we had about her were tinged with derision or disgust. Worry pulled us closer to each other, made us ever bolder and more obnoxious. Surely, we thought, we would push her to a point where the real adult she&#x2019;d kept cloaked so well would reveal itself. Like most children, we assumed all adults were naturally imbued with a sense of intimidation, of authority.<br><br>Besides her lack of substance, there were fundamental ways in which my mother might be considered a failure. She was a slipshod cook (her steamed broccoli was rubbery, its florets bristling with the crunchy carcasses of minuscule unseen beetles, her roasted chicken squeaky with blood) and an only occasional housekeeper--our father had bought her a vacuum cleaner, but it sat neglected in the coat closet until Owen and I one day dissected it for its parts. Nor did she seem to have any interests. We never saw her reading or writing or painting or gardening, all pastimes that we (even then) knew were of intrinsic worth and interest. On summer afternoons, we&#x2019;d sometimes find her sitting in the living room, her legs tucked under her girlishly, a silly smile on her face, staring fixedly yet vacantly at a vast constellation of dust motes made visible by a stripe of sunlight.<br><br>Once I saw her praying. I went into the living room one afternoon after school and found her on her knees, her palms pressed together, her head lifted. Her lips were moving, but I couldn&#x2019;t hear what she was saying. She looked ridiculous, like an actress playing to an empty theater, and I was embarrassed for her. &#x201c;What are you doing?&#x201d; I asked, and she looked up, alarmed. &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; she said, startled. But I knew what she was doing and knew too that she was lying.<br><br>What else can I say? I can say she was vague, drifty, probably even stupid. But here I must also say that she has remained an enigma to me, which is a difficult thing for any human to accomplish. And there are other things I remember of her as well: she was tall, and graceful, and although I am unable to recollect the specificities of her face, I know she was somewhat beautiful. An old, blurred sepia photograph Owen has hanging in his office confirms this. She was probably not considered as beautiful then as she would be now, for her face was ahead of her times--long, white, startled: a face that promised intelligence, mystery, depth. Today she would be called arresting. But my father must have considered her very beautiful, for I can think of no other reason that he might have married her. My father, when he spoke to women at all, enjoyed well-educated women, though he did not find them in any way sexually appealing. I assume this is because intelligent women reminded him of his sister, Sybil, who was a doctor in Rochester and whom he admired enormously. So he was left with beauty. It disappointed me when I discerned as an adolescent that my father had married my mother only for her beauty, but this was before I realized that parents disappoint us in many ways and it is best not to expect anything of them at all, for chances are that they won&#x2019;t be able to deliver it.<br><br>Mostly, though, she was unknowable. I don&#x2019;t even know where she came from exactly (somewhere in Nebraska, I believe), but I do know she was from a poor family, and my father, with his relative fortune and undemanding nature, had saved her. But curiously, for all her poverty, there was nothing work-worn or used about her; she did not appear to be depleted, nor hardened. Rather, she gave the impression of being one of those indulged women who floats from her father&#x2019;s home to the finishing school and into her husband&#x2019;s arms. (The glow that seems to surround her in Owen&#x2019;s photograph, her early, quiet death, her sleepy, slow movements, all make me remember her as luminous, protected, cosseted, even though I know otherwise.) As far as I know, she had no education (reading our report cards aloud to my father, she stumbled over words: &#x201c;Ex-, ex-em-pu,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d sound out before Owen or I would shout out the word--Exemplary--to her, smug and impatient and ashamed), and she was very young when she died.<br><br>But then too, she was young in all things. In my memories she is persistently childlike, not only in behavior but in appearance as well. Her hair, for example: no matter the occasion, she wore it loose, rippling down her back in a loose, snaking helix. Even when I was a child, this hairstyle of hers was troublesome to me; I saw it as further evidence of a rigorously, inappropriately maintained girlhood--the long hair, the distant, vacuous smile, the way her eyes would wander from yours the moment you began to speak to her, all things not admirable in a woman with her supposed responsibilities.<br><br>It is discomfiting to me now, as I list these few details of my mother&#x2019;s life, how little I know and how incurious I have remained about her. I suppose every child yearns to understand his parental origins, but I never found her an interesting enough person to consider. (Or should that reasoning be inverted?) But then, I have never believed in romancing the past--what good would it do me? Owen, however, later became much more interested in our mother, and even passed through a period as an undergraduate in which he attempted to trace her family and complete an informal biography of her. He abandoned the project months after its inception, however, and became very defensive about it when asked, so I can only assume he found our maternal relatives without much trouble, realized they were yokels, and gave the whole thing up in disgust (he was still enough of an avowed elitist back then to do exactly that).<b> (2)</b>&nbsp;She has always mattered to him in a way that I have never been able to understand. But then, Owen is a poet, and I believe he thought it important that he have these details available for future employment, however mediocre or ultimately disappointing they may have been.<br><br>At any rate. It was July of 1933. I hesitate to say &#x201c;It was a day like any other,&#x201d; for it sounds so melodramatic and portentous, as well as wholly unbelievable. Yet it is also true. So: it was a day like any other. My father was off with his friend Lester Drew, a small-time farmer, doing whatever it was two small-time farmers did together. Owen and I were gathering a bucket of leeches that we planned to bake into a pie and then give to Ida, the part-time cook, a sour woman we both hated. My mother was dangling her feet in the stream.<br><br>For weeks afterward, Owen and I would be asked to try to remember--had anything seemed different about her that afternoon? Had she seemed listless, or ill, or particularly fatigued? Had she spoken to us of feeling dizzy or weak? But the answer was always no. Indeed, if I can tell you very little about my mother&#x2019;s actions or mood that day, it is probably because they so closely resembled what we had come to accept as her normal behavior. As exasperating as our mother was, we could never accuse her of inconsistency. Even her last day of life followed that same inscrutable rhythm that only she could decipher.<br><b>(1)</b>&nbsp;The Owen to whom Norton refers is Owen C. Perina, Norton&#x2019;s twin brother and one of the few significant adult relationships in his life. Unlike Norton, Owen was always interested in literature, and he is now a renowned poet and the Field--Patey Professor of Poetry at Bard College. He has also twice been awarded the National Book Award for poetry, once for The Insect&#x2019;s Hand and Other Poems (1984) and again for The Pillow Book of Philip Perina (1995), as well as numerous other commendations. Owen is as famously taciturn as Norton is voluble, and I once witnessed a very amusing exchange between them when I visited Norton a few Christmases ago. There was Norton, fist full of chestnuts, spewing, chewing, gesticulating, holding forth on everything from the dying art of butterfly mounting to the strange appeal of a certain talk show, and across from him, his lumpish mirror image, grunting and murmuring his occasional assent or dissent, was Owen. Sadly, Norton and his brother are now at irreconcilable odds. As these pages will reveal, their estrangement was abrupt and devastating, the result of a terrible betrayal, one from which Norton will never recover.<br><br><b>(2)</b>&nbsp;Owen Perina has written a rather lovely poem about his mother and her death; it is the first poem in his third collection, Moth and Honey (1986).</p><h2>The Glory of Roses</h2><p>Examines the origin and history of the rose, as well as its lore, uses, and appearance in art and literature</p><p>Allen Lacy, for many years garden columnist for The New York Times, has been publishing the newsletter Allen Lacy's Homeground since 1993. He is the author or editor of 12 books on gardening, the most recent being The Inviting Garden: Gardening for the Senses, Mind, &amp; Spirit (Holt, 1998). He is Professor of Philosophy at Richard Stockton College of New Jersey in Pomona. <p>Christopher Baker is a New York-based photographer who has worked for international clients, photographing food, gardens, and cosmetics. He has 15 books to his credit.</p>This bounteous book, brimming with color photographs on virtually every page, would make a graceful addition to any rose-lover's coffee table. And while not the hands-on sort of production that readers might expect from Lacy (see preceding review), the text is thick with know-how and consistently entertaining. Though admitting that he is no rosarian, Lacy loves roses well enough to savor their singular beauty and delve into the rich vein of history and lore that surrounds them. He cites writers, from Pliny to Washington Post columnist Henry Mitchell, who have aided and abetted the rose as the pre-eminent flower--and a powerful symbol--in Western culture. The author also muses on the vagaries of rose nomenclature, by which, for example, the French Rose du Roi became Lee's Crimson Perpetual in England following the Napoleonic Wars. (Nowadays plants are frequently named after not-so-imperial icons, such as Jiminy Cricket and the Chrysler Imperial.) Gardeners yearning for a new growing season should find solace and inspiration in Baker's photographs, which capture roses in all their splendor, whether in the exquisite enclaves of Giverny and Sissinghurst or naturalized on the New England coastline. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>ABC 1-2-3: Fingerspelling and Numbers in ASL</h2><p>Thin Book, 61 Pages w/ CD.</p><p></p><h2>Luck: The Brilliant Randomness of Everyday Life</h2><p>Reflects on the nature of luck and its role in war, business, lotteries, and romance, and explains why humans ought to reduce their reliance on it</p><p>Nicholas Rescher is University Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pittsburgh.From the roll of the dice in a craps game to the questions that show up on the SAT, our lives are constantly affected by luck. But what is the nature of luck? What role has it played in history? These questions and many more are tackled in this unique book, which looks at luck from multiple perspectives, including how language shapes the way we think about luck; the differences between luck, fortune, and fate; the history of the idea of luck in the Western tradition; and the impossibility of shaping or directing luck. Rescher has no use for such superstitions as rabbit's feet or knocking on wood, but he supports the belief that luck favors the prepared. He encourages the reader to take reasonable, carefully calculated risks, assuming that luck will run favorably more frequently than unfavorably. Finally, he contends that, without luck, life as we know it would be unsustainable, that the randomness of good and bad luck gives life the spice that makes it palatable. This is a fascinating look at an underexplored topic. <i>George Needham</i></p><h2>Randomness</h2><p><p> From the ancients' first readings of the innards of birds to your neighbor's last bout with the state lottery, humankind has put itself into the hands of chance. Today life itself may be at stake when probability comes into play--in the chance of a false negative in a medical test, in the reliability of DNA findings as legal evidence, or in the likelihood of passing on a deadly congenital disease--yet as few people as ever understand the odds. This book is aimed at the trouble with trying to learn about probability. A story of the misconceptions and difficulties civilization overcame in progressing toward probabilistic thinking, <i>Randomness</i> is also a skillful account of what makes the science of probability so daunting in our own day. </p><p> To acquire a (correct) intuition of chance is not easy to begin with, and moving from an intuitive sense to a formal notion of probability presents further problems. Author Deborah Bennett traces the path this process takes in an individual trying to come to grips with concepts of uncertainty and fairness, and also charts the parallel path by which societies have developed ideas about chance. Why, from ancient to modern times, have people resorted to chance in making decisions? Is a decision made by random choice "fair"? What role has gambling played in our understanding of chance? Why do some individuals and societies refuse to accept randomness at all? If understanding randomness is so important to probabilistic thinking, why do the experts disagree about what it really is? And why are our intuitions about chance almost always dead wrong? </p><p> Anyone who has puzzled over a probability conundrum is struck by the paradoxes and counterintuitive results that occur at a relatively simple level. Why this should be, and how it has been the case through the ages, for bumblers and brilliant mathematicians alike, is the entertaining and enlightening lesson of <i>Randomness</i>. </p></p><p>"Chance governs all," said Milton, but he was writing about hell, not statistical probability. In the modern world, we assume that Milton's hell is everywhere--that is, that fate is best described in terms of statistics, odds, risks, and randomness. But most people, even many scientists, find probability difficult to understand and often counter to common sense. Mathematician Deborah Bennett looks at the history of statistics, games of chance and the casting of lots, the "Monty Hall" problem, and sources of random numbers. "Every day we can see evidence that the human species does not yet have a very highly developed probabilistic sense." With more books like Bennett's, we may in time become better at it--chances are. <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i>[Randomness] can most easily be described as a brief history of chance...I can cheerfully recommend it to anyone who is a total beginner when it comes to probability, what it means, why it is desperately puzzling, and what it can do for us despite that...It is fascinating to read about the pioneers of probability, such as Pierre Simon de Laplace with his &#39;normal distribution&#39;-now more familiar as the notorious bell curve-and Adolphe Quetelet, perhaps the first to realize that there are statistical patterns in human behavior. And I applaud the blunt reminder that when it comes to the real world the &#39;normal&#39; distribution is actually highly abnormal...My main criticism: it left me wanting more.

The great winged Lion stares over a Venice where magic thrives. The rich Venetian Republic is a bastion of independence and tolerance. Perhaps for that reason, it is also corrupt, and rotten with intrigue.<br> <br>But for the young brothers Marco and Benito Valdosta, vagabond and thief, Venice is simply home. They have no idea that they stand at the center of the city's coming struggle for its very life. They know nothing of the powerful forces moving in the background. They have barely heard of Chernobog, demonlord of the North, who is shifting his pawns to attack Venice in order to cut into the underbelly of the Holy Roman Empire. All Marco and Benito know is that they're hungry and in dangerous company: Katerina the smuggler, Caesare the sell-sword, Montagnard assassins, church inquisitors, militant Knights of the Holy Trinity, Dottore Marina the Strega mage ...and Maria. Maria might be an honest canaler, but she had the hottest temper a boy could find.<br> <br>Yet among the dark waters of the canals lurk far worse dangers than a hot-tempered girl. Chernobog has set a monster loose to wreak havoc on the city. Magic, murder and evil are all at work to pull Venice down. Fanatical monks seek to root out true witchcraft with fire and sword. Steel-clad Teutonic knights, wealth traders, church dignitaries and great Princes fight and plot for control of the jewel of the Mediterranean.<br> <br>And somehow all of these, from thieves to mages to princes, must gather around Marco and his brother Benito, under the shadow of the great winged lion of Venice.</p><p>New York Times bestselling author Mercedes Lackey has written over one hundred titles and has no plans to slow down. Known best for her tales of Valdemar and The Five Hundred Kingdoms, she&#39;s also a prolific lyricist and records her own music.The prolific Lackey (the Bardic Voices series, the Urban Faerie series, etc.) and cohorts Flint (1632) and Freer (The Forlorn) whip up a luscious bouillabaisse of politics, intrigue, love and black magic set in an "Other-worldly, New-Age Venice." Like the actual 16th-century city-state, the authors' Venice of the 1530s is a dangerous place, filled with as many illicit love affairs as murders. Garbage and occasional dead bodies float in the stinking canals. The city is also a target for would-be foreign conquerors: the Vatican, the Holy Roman Empire, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland, and the small city-state of Ferrara, ruled by Enrico Dell'este, who surreptitiously watches his grandsons, Marco and Benito, the story's water-rat heroes. Around Benito, a thief, and Marco, a canal doctor, swirl a host of characters, major and minor: the men and women who ply the gondolas and rafts; the spy Caesare Aldanto, the boys' supporter; plus courtesans, whores, monks, priests, knights, shamans, undines and the demon Chernobog. Meanwhile, the winged lion of St. Mark's, symbol of Venice, is stirring, and its shadow falls on Marco as the city's future ruler. The authors' use of contemporary American vernacular "get real," "fat chance," etc. instead of pompous period speech keeps the pages turning fast, but the last-minute stampede of fantastic monsters that abruptly resolves the story's various conflicts makes for a clunky climax. In a book this fat the glossary at the end is essential. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Drawings by Holbein from the court of Henry VIII: Fifty drawings from the collection of Her Majesty the Queen, Windsor Castle, Art Gallery of Ontario, ... 28 October 1988-15 January 1989 : catalogue</h2><p>Drawings by Holbein from the court of Henry VIII: Fifty Drawings from the Collection of Her Majesty the Queen, Windsor Castle, Art Gallery of Ontario, ... 28 October 1988-15 January 1989 : Catalogue</p><p></p><h2>Outsmart Your Cancer: Alternative Non-Toxic Treatments That Work</h2><p><b>***These Reviews refer to an edition that is Out of Print.

Bound in publisher&#39;s original white cloth. Dust jacket.</p><p>Brice Marden's art is deceptively austere. Within the seemingly narrow color range of his paintings and drawings, he orchestrates remarkable thematic variations of color, light, scale and mood. His monochromatic gray palette of the 1960s, expressing a ``vocabulary of ambiguities,'' gave way to limpid motions and a neoclassical exploration of color-and-light relationships. Kertess, a curator at New York City's Whitney Museum, links the elemental grace of Marden's more recent works to this American artist's summer sojourns on Hydra, a Greek island in the Aegean Sea. In Marden's organic, cellular structures, Kertess sees the influence of Chinese calligraphy and Marden's trips to the Far East. Illustrated with 158 plates (133 in color), this handsome monograph follows Marden's metamorphosis from a pure abstractionist to an artist seeking to objectify the spiritual, as he does in his Annunciation series and in the Elements, which are symbolic paintings rooted in medieval alchemy. <p></p><p>Copyright 1992 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>This liberally illustrated retrospective look at Marden's work provides the first comprehensive visual overview of his creative output from the 1950s through the 1980s. In a brief accompanying essay, Kertess, formerly Marden's art dealer and now with the Whitney Museum of American Art, gives a tantalizing glimpse into the life and works of the artist. Unfortunately, discussions of the works illustrated in the book are not cited by page or plate number, making quick reference difficult. Still, the extensive bibliography and detailed list of exhibitions make this a useful research tool. Recommended for large collections on U.S. or contemporary art. --Martin R. Kalfatovic, Natl.

This book deals with both the campaign fought by British, Commonwealth and other security forces in Malaya against Communist insurgents, between 1948 and 1960, and also the security action in North Borneo during the period of Confrontation with Indonesia from 1962 to 1966. Both campaigns provided invaluable experience in the development of anti-guerrilla tactics, and are relevant to the conduct of similar actions which have been fought against insurgent elements since then. The book, written with the full cooperation of various departments of the UK Ministry of Defense, contains material that until recently remained classified.<br><br>This is the first full study to cover the role of airpower in these conflicts. It will be of relevance to students at military colleges, and those studying military history, as well as having a more general appeal, particularly to those servicemen and women who were involved in both campaigns.</p><p>Robert Jackson is the author of over eighty books on military, aviation, naval and scientific subjects.

They have collaborated on nineteen previous Mrs. Murphy mysteries: <i>Wish You Were Here; Rest in Pieces; Murder at Monticello; Pay Dirt; Murder, She Meowed; Murder on the Prowl; Cat on the Scent; Pawing Through the Past; Claws and Effect; Catch as Cat Can; The Tail of the Tip-Off; Whisker of Evil; Cat&#x2019;s Eyewitness; Sour Puss; Puss &#x2019;n Cahoots; The Purrfect Murder; Santa Clawed; Cat of the Century;</i> and <i>Hiss of Death,</i> in addition to <i>Sneaky Pie&#x2019;s Cookbook for Mystery Lovers.</i>A red-shouldered hawk, tiny mouse in her talons, swooped in front of the 2007 Outback rolling along the wet country road. She landed in an old cherry tree covered in pink blossoms, which fluttered to the ground from the hawk&#x2019;s light impact. <br><br>&#x201c;Will you look at that?&#x201d; Miranda Hogendobber exclaimed from behind the Outback&#x2019;s wheel, as she drove to the garden center over in Waynesboro. <br><br>&#x201c;Raptors fascinate me, but they scare me, too,&#x201d; Harry Haristeen remarked. &#x201c;Poor little mouse.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;There is that.&#x201d; Miranda slowed for a sharp curve. <br><br>Central Virginia, celebrating high spring, was also digging out from torrential rains over the weekend. <br><br>Harry, forty and fit, and Miranda, late sixties and not advertising, had worked together for years at the old Crozet post office. <br><br>When Miranda&#x2019;s husband, George, died, Harry, fresh from Smith College, took his position as head of the P.O., never thinking the job would last nearly two decades. Miranda, despite her loss, showed up every day to help orient the young woman whom she&#x2019;d known as a baby. Harry&#x2019;s youth raised Miranda&#x2019;s spirits. In mourning, it&#x2019;s especially good to have a task. Over the years they became extremely close, almost a mother&#x2013;daughter bond. Harry&#x2019;s mother had died when Harry was in her early twenties. <br><br>Noticing fields filled with the debris of the now-subsiding waters, Harry observed, &#x201c;What a mess. Can&#x2019;t turn out stock in that. You just don&#x2019;t know what else is wrapped up in all those branches and twigs.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, there&#x2019;s a plastic chair. Might look good in your yard.&#x201d; Miranda smiled. <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Harry drawled the word out, like the native Southerner she was. <br><br>The younger woman, generous with her time and happy to feed anyone, could be tight with the buck. Miranda couldn&#x2019;t resist teasing Harry about a free if ugly chair. <br><br>&#x201c;This is sure better than my 1961 Falcon,&#x201d; the older woman said. &#x201c;Initially I resisted the Outback&#x2019;s fancy radio. I mean, this is a used car and had the Sirius capabilities, but I didn&#x2019;t want to pay extra. How did I live without it?&#x201d; Miranda mused, now a Subaru convert. <br><br>&#x201c;Regular cars can now do more than Mercedes or even Rolls from ten years ago. That&#x2019;s what amazes me: the speed with which the technological developments of those high-end cars became commonplace in much-lower-priced vehicles. But I still love my old 1978 F-150 and you still drive your old Falcon. Hey, want me to wax it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Would you? What a lovely offer.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You know how crazy I get with anything with an engine in it. I&#x2019;ll clean the tires, refresh your dash. I&#x2019;m a one-woman detailing operation.&#x201d; <br><br>Her eyebrows knitting together, Miranda said, &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d; <br><br>An odd pop, then a lurch, made holding the Outback on theroad difficult. <br><br>&#x201c;Put on your flashers and brake.&#x201d; <br><br>They slid toward a narrow drainage ditch, and the airbags billowed up inside as the wheel dipped in the ditch. Miranda couldn&#x2019;t see. <br><br>If there was enough room, narrow drainage ditches, about one to two feet deep, paralleled the country roads. Occasionally, small culverts passed the runoff under farm driveways or sharp curves, moving the water, which could rise very quickly, away from the roads. <br><br>Even without vision, Miranda was not one to panic. She braked smoothly, and the right side of the car dropped into the ditch. The car rocked a little. <br><br>Asleep on the backseat, Harry&#x2019;s two cats and dog rolled off. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Pewter, the rotund gray cat, howled. <br><br>The tiger cat, Mrs. Murphy, and the corgi, Tee Tucker, scrambled back up on the seat. <br><br>&#x201c;No other cars,&#x201d; the dog noted. <br><br>The tiger cat looked around. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was asleep.&#x201d; Pewter hauled herself up to sit next to her friends. <br><br>&#x201c;We all were,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy drily noted. <br><br>&#x201c;Well&#x2014;I was more asleep.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry, already outside, having punctured the air bag with the penknife she always carried in her hip pocket, crouched down to look at the undercarriage. Then she walked to the right front side of the car, front end inthe ditch. <br><br>&#x201c;See anything?&#x201d; As best she could, Miranda rolled up her air bag, which Harry had also punctured. <br><br>Harry called back, &#x201c;Your right tire is cracked; the rubber&#x2019;s flat, too. Do you have Triple A?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; Miranda slid out as Harry helped her. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m going to call Safe and Sound instead.&#x201d; <br><br>Safe &amp; Sound, founded and run by Alphonse &#x201c;Latigo&#x201d; Bly, was headquartered in Charlottesville. Specializing in auto insurance, the company covered the mid-Atlantic and coastal South. Many business people believed Safe &amp; Sound would go national, sooner or later. <br><br>As Miranda called, Harry opened the back door of the Outback. <br><br>&#x201c;Does anyone need to go potsie?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Must she put it that way?&#x201d; Pewter grumbled. &#x201c;And I am not about to get my paws wet.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re okay.&#x201d; The corgi answered for the rest of the animals. Not seeing one of her best friends budge, Harry closed the door to the rear, then did her best to fold her air bag back into the dash. <br><br>Miranda was already on the phone with Safe &amp; Sound, spilling out details, perhaps too many. <br><br>With difficulty, Harry opened the glove compartment, pulling out the manual. <br><br>Having concluded her phone conversation, Miranda informed Harry, &#x201c;Someone will be here in twenty minutes. Says don&#x2019;t call Triple A. He takes care of this stuff all the time.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Always best to do business with friends,&#x201d; Harry observed. &#x201c;When you try to save money, you usually waste time or spend even more money. Safe and Sound is local.&#x201d; <br><br>Miranda sighed. &#x201c;The older I get, the more I realize time is more precious than money.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry, flipping through the manual, stopped at a schematic drawing of the auto frame. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not old. Anyone who sings in the choir, gardens like you do, and is a member of every &#x2018;do-good&#x2019; group in the state of Virginia isn&#x2019;t old.&#x201d; Changing the subject&#x2014;a habit with dear friends&#x2014;Harry declared, &#x201c;Whatever happened, it wasn&#x2019;t the engine. It may be a defective wheel, but there was that odd pop sound.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I couldn&#x2019;t steer after that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Weird.&#x201d; Harry glanced back at the manual. &#x201c;Subaru makes great cars for the money.&#x201d; A fresh breeze brought the aroma of blossoms, flowers, and hay coming up, filling her nostrils. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be curious to find out what happened. How lucky we were that the car swerved to the right, not the left into oncoming traffic. Better yet, there wasn&#x2019;t any traffic.&#x201d; Miranda exhaled. <br><br>&#x201c;Monday afternoon. Everyone&#x2019;s at work or in the fields. Herb&#x2019;s truck is in the shop, too, after his collision last week,&#x201d; Harry said, thinking of the minister at St. Luke&#x2019;s Lutheran Church, the Very Reverend Herbert Jones. &#x201c;Things go in threes. Maybe I&#x2019;m next.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what happened, but I bet that will cost Herb an arm and a leg. Truck&#x2019;s still at ReNu,&#x201d; Miranda said, naming the garage favored by the insurance company. &#x201c;He was driving his Chevy truck. His &#x2018;bigfib&#x2019; truck.&#x201d; <br><br>They laughed, because the Chevy, used for fishing and filled with tackle, was also filled with fish stories. Oh, how Herb could wax poetic on the one that got away! He was also all too happy to show what he had actually snagged, though the cats generally proved more interested in the display than did the humans. <br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to be stuck on the side of the road, best it happens on a beautiful spring day.&#x201d; Harry smiled. &#x201c;We were lucky. Unlike Tara Meola.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry shuddered at the thought of the poor young woman killed last week in the hard rains when a deer smashed into her vehicle. <br><br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Miranda nodded. <br><br>&#x201c;You just never know,&#x201d; Harry sighed.<br>2 <br><br>After a bitterly cold winter, spring had stayed cool until late April. It was now late May. Nights in the mid-forties or mid-fifties promised days in the sixties. Late-blooming dogwoods dotted the forests and manicured lawns. Over pergolas, the wisteria hung pendulous with lavender or white blossoms. The roses threatened to riot. <br><br>Harry walked through her tended acres. The farm maintained a healthy balance of crops, hay, and woodlands. Mrs. Murphy, Tucker, and Pewter followed, taking numerous side trips to investigate rabbit warrens and fox dens. The butterflies danced together, swirling, fluttering their beautiful veined wings. <br><br>Eying them deviously, Pewter crouched down. <br><br>&#x201c;They see you,&#x201d; Tucker said. <br><br>Ignoring the ever-practical dog, Pewter wiggled her gray butt, then leapt upward. <br><br>Without breaking rhythm, the butterflies flew away. <br><br>&#x201c;Almost had &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Dream on,&#x201d; the corgi teased. <br><br>Mrs. Murphy at her heels, Harry turned. &#x201c;Come on, you two.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s always giving orders,&#x201d; Pewter grumbled. <br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; the handsome dog agreed. &#x201c;And she also always feeds us on time.&#x201d; <br><br>Considering this, the fat cat trotted toward Harry, who was now leaning over to inspect the tops of sunflower plants just breaking the surface. <br><br>&#x201c;With a little luck, I&#x2019;m going to have a good year.&#x201d;Harry smiled, then moved on to her quarter acre of Petit Manseng grapes. <br><br>Dr. Thomas Walker, Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s gu...</p><h2>A Place of Springs: A History of the Dominican Sisters of St. Mary of the Springs (1830-1970)</h2><p>150 years of history of the Sisters of St. Mary of the springs</p><p></p><h2>Diagnosis and Treatment of Feeding Disorders in Infants, Toddlers, and Young Children</h2><p>Delays in development, as well as in growth, can occur when a feeding disorder arises.

In the last section, which was never written, Stendhal had planned to show Lucien in Italy and to resolve the story with a happy ending based on the return of Mme de Chasteller. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>The Crystal Frontier: A Novel in Nine Stories</h2><p>Mexico&#39;s leading novelist presents a dramatic fictional portrait of the relationship between the United States and Mexico, as played out in a Mexican dynasty led by a powerful Mexican oligarch with complex ties north of the border. 25,000 first printing.</p><p><p>Carlos Fuentes is the author of more than a dozen novels,&nbsp;including <em>Terra Nostra</em>, <em>The Old Gringo</em>, <em>The Crystal Frontier</em>, and <em>The Years with Laura Diaz</em>, as well as numerous literary and political essays.

We can easily recognize its telltale signs--redness, heat, pain, and swelling--every time we get a bump, bruise, or rash. Yet the role of inflammation isn't just skin-deep. In fact, as revealed in this eye-opening book, discovering inflammation's function is a far-reaching, giant leap forward in our understanding of disease prevention and treatment.</p> <p>While inflammation is your first line of defense against bacteria and viruses, long-term or severe inflammation can cause serious health problems. Both the <i>New York Times</i> and CNN have recently reported that inflammation is the common thread in heart disease and other major illnesses, as well as a host of diseases related to aging, including arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and some forms of cancer. It's now suggested that the key to good health may lie in finding the right balance between the body's intricate pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory forces.</p> <p>Not long ago, most inflammation research was tied to particular medical specialties such as rheumatology or cardiology. When pioneering doctors began to look beyond the narrow confines of specialization, they made the "inflammation connection." It was discovered that rather than being disease-specific, inflammation is an underlying factor in many diseases previously thought to be unrelated.</p> <p><i>The Inflammation Cure</i> is at the forefront of this bold new movement in inflammation research. In clear, everyday language, William Meggs, M.D., originator of the inflammation-related theory of neurogenic switching, explains what causes inflammation, its critical relationship to disease in the body, and--most importantly--what steps you can take <i>right now</i> to minimize your inflammation risk.</p> <p><i>The Inflammation Cure</i>:</p> <ul> <li>Defines inflammation and how it works to protect or harm the body </li><li>Features an Inflammation Risk Quiz designed to assess your personal risk factors </li><li>Uncovers how inflammatory processes contribute to the big killers--heart disease, stroke, and diabetes--and how these same processes might put you at risk for other inflammation-related disorders </li><li>Explains why inflammation and aging are so interconnected </li><li>Helps you manage your body's inflammation responses through exercise, diet, lifestyle changes, medical tests, and new anti-inflammatory foods and medications </li></ul> <p>Inflammation affects us all--especially today, when our nation is grappling with the healthcare implications of an aging population added to an explosion of inflammation-related health problems such as obesity and asthma. The simple truth is: the more we understand the link between inflammation and our health, the closer we come to effectively treating, and possibly eradicating, some of the most deadly diseases ever known. Shouldn't inflammation control be a major part of your overall personal health plan? Let <i>The Inflammation Cure</i> be your guide.</p> <p><b>Know the Facts. Know Your Risk. Make the Inflammation Connection.</b></p> <p>Think of the last time you got a scrape or cut. The swelling and redness that resulted is inflammation in action, protecting us from serious infections and healing our injuries.</p> <p>But inflammation processes can and <i>do</i> malfunction. Just as inflammation destroys germs, <i>uncontrolled</i> inflammation can, over time, destroy the organs of our own bodies. The pivotal role of inflammation in heart disease, as well as diseases tied to aging such as Alzheimer's and arthritis, has been little understood. Until now.</p> <p><i>The Inflammation Cure</i> opens a window on what is arguably the most dynamic concept in disease prevention and treatment today. As research continues, the link between inflammation and seemingly unrelated health problems--touching on all areas of medicine--gets stronger and more compelling. In a clear, easy-to-understand tone, William Meggs, M.D., and Carol Svec help you guard against the life-threatening dangers of severe or long-term inflammation.</p> <p>This much-needed, comprehensive guide reviews:</p> <ul> <li>The inflammation connection and its impact on your health and aging </li><li>The physiological factors that trigger inflammation </li><li>The link between inflammation and fatigue, obesity, depression, and insomnia </li><li>A lifestyle, diet, and medication program that lowers your risk and promotes wellness </li><li>And much more </li></ul> <p>A more complete understanding of inflammation ushers in an era of great possibilities--a revolutionary era when treating diseases such as asthma and diabetes will be akin to treating the common cold.

She&#x2019;s able to trace the torso in the cooler back to a man who mysteriously disappeared weeks earlier after a hurricane hit the Atlantic coast of Florida. How did his body end up six hundred miles away in the Gulf of Mexico?&nbsp; Using her signature keen instincts and fearless investigating, O&#x2019;Dell discovers Florida&#x2019;s seedy underworld and the shady characters who inhabit it.&nbsp; <i>Damaged</i> is Alex Kava&#x2019;s most terrifying thriller yet.</p><p><strong>Steve Berry Reviews <em>Damaged</em></strong> <p><strong>Steve Berry is the author of six thrillers in the bestselling Cotton Malone series (<em>The Templar Legacy</em>, <em>The Alexandria Link</em>, <em>The Venetian Betrayal</em>, <em>The The Charlemagne Pursuit</em>, <em>The Paris Vendetta</em>, and <em>The Emperor's Tomb</em>), and three stand-alone thrillers (<em>The Amber Room</em>, <em>The Romanov Prophecy</em>, and <em>The Third Secret</em>). Read his guest review of <em>Damaged</em>:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Alex Kava is a master. Her heroine, Special Agent Maggie O'Dell, is one of the classic characters of the thriller genre. Maggie's adventures have taken her to small-town America, and into the Catholic Church, bringing her face-to-face with some sick individuals. But that's her job. She's a criminal profiler. And good at it. Now, in <em>Damaged</em>, Maggie is thrust into the eye of an impending monster hurricane to track down another killer.</p> <p>Alex Kava has a knack for the macabre. This time she hooks the reader when a fishing cooler is found floating in the Gulf of Mexico filled with a human torso, one foot, and three hands, all tightly wrapped in plastic. Despite the fact that a Category 5 hurricane is just off shore, and headed her way, Maggie is sent to investigate. Resources are limited. All law enforcement is focused on evacuation and emergency preparations. It's Maggie's job to find out what's going on, but when she discovers that the remains belong to a man who mysteriously disappeared weeks earlier, after another hurricane hit on Florida&#x2019;s Atlantic Ocean side, the real trouble begins.</p> <p>There's a ton more to this story, but I don't want to give away too much. Let's just say that it's unexpected. Once again Alex Kava has concocted a tale similar to speeding at a hundred miles an hour down a giant slalom course, with all its associated twists and turns. The whole thing starts fast and gets faster. Maggie O'Dell is a brilliant and complicated heroine--at once witty, smart, and detailed, but always highly entertaining. <em>Damaged</em> is a book from a writer who knows how to deliver exactly what readers want. Alex Kava is in the top echelon of suspense masters and this one is not to be missed.</p> <br> <br> <p><strong>Questions for Alex Kava on <em>Damaged</em></strong></p> <p> </p> <p><b>Q:</b> Where did the inspiration for <i>Damaged</i> come from? Why did you decide to send Maggie O&#x2019;Dell into the path of a deadly hurricane?<br> <b>A:</b> In spring of 2004 I bought a house on the bay just outside of Pensacola. Six months later Hurricane Ivan hit. Nine months after that, it was Dennis. I&#x2019;ve lived most of my life in tornado country so I thought I was prepared for hurricanes. The anxiety and anticipation is excruciating. And nothing prepares you for the aftermath. It&#x2019;s hard to explain. It may sound a bit clich�d but there&#x2019;s a transformation that takes place when you experience something like that, especially as a community. I&#x2019;ve been wanting to throw Maggie into the path of a hurricane ever since.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> You write in great detail about FBI processes and forensic investigations. How did you do research in these areas?<br> <b>A:</b> Real experts are still the best sources of information. I've been very fortunate to have contacts in a variety of law enforcement and forensic fields, people I can call or email with questions. Some have become close friends who share details of their cases with me over dinner. I&#x2019;ve also had the privilege of visiting Quantico, and was able to spend some time down in the Behavioral Science Unit talking to special agents who do every day what I only write about.<br><br> What I don&#x2019;t know, I read, constantly. I now have an extensive library of my own and anyone who checked my laptop&#x2019;s cache would probably be shocked to see the types of websites I surf on a regular basis.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> In <i>Damaged</i>, you write about the black market for human organs. Where did that idea come from and how did you research?<br> <b>A:</b> Several years ago I read a special report in <i>USA Today</i> about the illegal body parts business. It mentioned a case in Brooklyn involving a body broker and several funeral homes that were stealing tissue and bone from corpses, in some instances, replacing the bones with PVC piping and hiding the theft by sewing the bodies back up. Sometimes entire bodies were stolen instead of being sent to the crematory. The indictment charged that as many as 1,000 bodies may have stolen by this one group.<br><br> It fascinated me how greed could literally eviscerate a solemn practice that we take for granted and expect to be treated with dignity and respect.<br><br> From then on I started searching for and saving anything I could find on the subject. I read several books including Annie Cheney&#x2019;s <em>Body Brokers</em> and Kathy Braidhill&#x2019;s <em>Chop Shop</em>.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Tell us about Maggie O&#x2019;Dell. Where did the inspiration for her character come from, and is she based on a real life person? <br> <b>A:</b> I never intended for Maggie to be a series character, so she&#x2019;s had to evolve and reveal herself to me with each novel. In the beginning with <em>A Perfect Evil</em> Maggie was a tough, young FBI agent driven much more by impulse and passion. She&#x2019;s matured a bit, though still driven to do the right thing. I think Maggie&#x2019;s a lot more accepting of who she is and less apologetic of how she goes about doing her job.<br><br> She&#x2019;s not, however, based on any one person and although she and I share some personality traits--our unintentional abuse of fine leather shoes and our love of college football--Maggie&#x2019;s certainly not my alter ego. For one thing she&#x2019;s much braver than I am.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Critics and fans alike have found your heroine, Special Agent Maggie O&#x2019;Dell, very appealing. What is it about her that readers can&#x2019;t get enough of?<br> <b>A:</b> I have to admit I&#x2019;m not sure what it is, because sometimes Maggie drives me crazy. What I hear from readers is they like that Maggie&#x2019;s not a superhero. They can relate to her. Yes, she might be an excellent profiler but she failed at her marriage and struggles with her personal relationships. She has flaws. She makes mistakes. But the bottom line is that Maggie does the right thing even when it&#x2019;s not the easy thing, even when it gets her in trouble or puts her in danger. I think readers admire that about her.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> What&#x2019;s next? Can you give us a preview of your next novel, and will we see more of Maggie O&#x2019;Dell?<br> <b>A:</b> Maggie will be back in <em>Hotwire</em>. Her boss sends her to the Midwest to investigate cattle mutilations in the area and Maggie stumbles upon a bizarre triple murder of some local teenagers.</p> (Alex Kava Photo � Deborah Groh Carlin) <br> <br><p><b>Alex Kava</b>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestselling author of the critically acclaimed Maggie O&#x2019;Dell series.

For decades he had traveled from his office in the Texas Heart Institute through the maze of attached hallways that was St. Luke&#x2019;s, a worn paperback perpetually open in his hand, often something by Shakespeare, rarely anything that could remotely be considered popular. At seventy-five, Bud had earned certain privileges: The right to walk and read, which kept a lot of people out of his way. The right to leave towels in swirls and eddies on the floor of the private bathroom in his office. The right to check his cellphone at society galas, because people assumed he was checking on patients, and sometimes he was. A few years back, Bud had had to give up his black cowboy boots for running shoes, because surgery, especially lengthy surgeries, could be as hard on your legs and your back as it was on your hands.

It made pretty women solicitous, which made him grouchy.</p><p>Bud&#x2019;s wife, Rachel, liked to describe her husband, generously, as an absentminded professor, but like many people at the top of their fields, Bud had lots of folks looking after the mundane details of his life so that he could focus on his work. Bud often forgot his wallet; he did not balance his checkbook; he did not &#x201c;do&#x201d; email. Once, when he could not find a parking place for a gala, he parked his old Jaguar XKE--a gift from a grateful patient--on the front patio of the Houston Museum of Natural Science, barely missing the fountains. Everyone forgave him his trespasses: Bud could list, among a very long list of friends and associates and patients and their family members, everyone from Mehmet Oz to the memoirist Mary Karr, from Dick Cheney to Bono, from Olivia de Havilland to various Middle Eastern and European royalty. He had a long-suffering assistant named Libby Schwenke who was charged with getting him from point A to point B, whether it was from Houston to Kazakhstan or just across the Texas Medical Center, which, unfortunately for her, was the largest in the world. Even so, Bud was perennially late, famous for slipping into a party or a lecture long after it was in progress, which allowed him to be simultaneously unobtrusive and a center of attention. Time for Bud was negotiable after so many years operating on the very sick, who didn&#x2019;t follow schedules either.</p><p>So here he was, at the crack of dawn, alone. Docs a lot younger than Bud, with better knees but slower hands, were still at home next to their sleeping wives at five-thirty in the morning. Whether he could admit it or not, Bud preferred his office to his home, surrounded by the books that were always in danger of tumbling off the shelves--valuable first editions and ratty paperbacks; Plutarch, Dickens, Dostoyevsky, a few nods to the likes of Hilary Mantel and Larry McMurtry. His literary tastes were a lot more high minded than those of the average medical student rotating through the Texas Heart Institute, a fact he sometimes couldn&#x2019;t resist noting--to his med students. (When it came to literature, Bud was an equal-opportunity snob: introduced to U2 frontman Bono by a wealthy friend, Bud was appalled when the Irish rock star didn&#x2019;t immediately recognize some lines Bud recited from Yeats.)</p><p>Bud opened the door and stepped into the outer office, with the bank of secretarial cubicles on one side and a wall of framed photos and clippings on the other. Because there wasn&#x2019;t any natural light here, the pictures were as fresh as the day they had been taken: photos of Bud with his mentors, Dr. Michael DeBakey and Dr. Denton Cooley, who had been among the most famous heart surgeons of their day in the years from 1960 to 1980 or so. In another photo, Bud posed with Christiaan Barnard, the South African surgeon who had shocked the world--and set off major envy attacks among his colleagues--by performing the first human heart transplant in 1969. There was a photo of Bud with the longest-living heart transplant patient in the world--his patient--and next to it a twenty-year-old story from the New York Times about the success of the left ventricular assist device. Bud had an impressive collection of medals, and on the highest shelf above his assistant&#x2019;s desk, a tenuously crowded collection of crystal vases and plaques etched with his name. There was a framed portrait with a quote from Teddy Roosevelt--a favorite of many aggrieved surgeons--about the man in the arena who, &#x201c;if he fails, fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#x201d; Close to that was another maxim: &#x201c;No one gets in to see the Wizard, not nobody, not no how,&#x201d; a former student had written, quoting the Wizard of Oz. It was an inside joke. Everyone got in; Bud Frazier was incapable of telling anyone no.</p><p>He padded down the dim hallway, past the open door to Billy Cohn&#x2019;s office, the heart surgeon who sometimes helped Bud--who was not mechanically minded--develop devices for ailing hearts. As often happened, Billy wasn&#x2019;t there; he spent weeks in other countries, testing and lecturing on his many inventions. But even when Billy was gone, his office seemed to be fully inhabited by him, by the whirs and clicks of all sorts of tiny machines that entranced him, by the perpetual motion of his screen savers on at least three computers and laptops, by the eerie blue light they projected around the room. Billy hung his oldest prototypes on the walls with regular nails and thumb tacks and sometimes, Scotch tape: a bent fork, a lariat made of thin white tubing, a kitchen spatula--all variants of things he had invented that went into people&#x2019;s bodies or helped heart surgeons do their jobs. Bud&#x2019;s office walls were paneled and book lined. Billy filled his space with trinkets, doodads, and gewgaws that only he fully understood. There were the books on magic piled on top of medical texts and a deck of cards on his desk--Billy performed at national conventions. There was a cover photo from a weekly tabloid of Billy playing the trombone with his band at a bar called the Boondocks, a late-night date he kept every Tuesday. This was a man whose fingers were still only when he was sleeping--if in fact Billy ever slept. Unlike Bud, Billy didn&#x2019;t keep a couch in his office.</p><p>Bud left his office suite and made for the elevators. He didn&#x2019;t stop on the ground floor, where he might have taken in his first exposure of the day to natural light--it poured into the three-story atrium of the Heart Institute&#x2019;s Denton A. Cooley wing, as if God himself were blessing the place. Instead, Cooley officed just behind the soaring space; at ninety-two, he still came in every day, getting around the hospital on a scooter or being pushed in a wheelchair by one of his former nurses. Fortunately, he was not such a bad driver.</p><p>At an elevator, Bud punched the button for the basement.</p><p>In the old days--the sixties, seventies, the early eighties--the animal research lab had been on the third floor of St. Luke&#x2019;s, adjacent to the operating rooms. Such a location would be unethical now--who would even think of it?--but back then laws on animal research were more lax, and, besides, if Cooley wanted it there so he could duck in and out between surgeries, he got whatever he wanted because he&#x2019;d founded the heart institute for starters, and he brought in the most patients, meaning, of course, he brought in the most money. The biggest problem with that location was that the obstetrics ward was also on the same floor, so the moans of women in labor were accompanied by the sounds of dogs barking, cows mooing, or the screeching of baboons.</p><p>The end of that situation came with what Bud still called The Incident of the Yucatan Mini Pigs. He had been working on some experiments that involved welding blood vessels together with lasers, and it turned out the veins of the 100-pound pigs were the closest things to humans. But then someone snuck in one night and freed pigs from their cages--probably an administrator, Bud still speculated darkly--so about twenty of them went racing into the maternity ward. Bud had to round up the mini pigs himself, herding them back into the lab as they snorted and relieved themselves all over the place. Soon after that, Cooley got a new cardiac research lab in the basement.</p><p>Bud had been in charge for the last forty years or so.</p><p>The door to the lab had a window covered with a venetian blind, a nod to security along with the key card Bud swiped to let himself in. The place wasn&#x2019;t much to look at, which made it camera ready for PETA membership drives. The floor was linoleum, and the tile walls were that sorry shade of prison green. The animals in metal stanchions--like modern-day stocks--raised their heads to look at Bud: one goat, one cow. At his arrival they blinked and chewed the hay at their feet, paying him little mind.</p><p>He had told his mother, a schoolteacher, that he&#x2019;d decided to become a doctor one night while she was cooking him dinner. He was in from Austin and the University of Texas, back home in the small town of Stephenville. She kept stirring a pot on the stove while he explained his choice; she didn&#x2019;t stop to look at him. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said, when he finished, &#x201c;I think you should do what you want, but I never knew you to much like to kill things.&#x201d; Well, &#x201c;killing things&#x201d; wasn&#x2019;t his goal as a doctor, but being an attentive son Bud intuited her meaning: with a mother&#x2019;s impeccable memory, she was referencing that time he was eight years old and his friend Butch Henry had shot a rabbit in the brush. Bud raced to the site and found a mother rabbit dying, her unborn babies tumbling out of her belly where the shotgun pellets had torn her open. Bud gathered up the tiny bundle of kits, raced home and tried to save them, but he was too late.</p><p>His life&#x2019;s through line became saving the unsavable. This made Bud not just famous and respected, but beloved, and not just in Houston but anywhere he had taken care of sick people around the world. But he still had one goal to accomplish before he hung it up: Bud wanted to see a working artificial heart become a reality, a total replacement that could be implanted and then forgotten, as his frenemy, another famous heart surgeon, Robert Jarvik liked to say. And, finally, Bud felt that he was close.</p><p>In the next room, Bud found the calf. He was a Corriente, a smallish breed descended from the Spanish. His coat was a reddish brown, soft and thick; in a different life he would have spent his youth avoiding cowboys in a roping competition at a rodeo. Instead, he was standing up in his small stall, wires and tubes running in and out of his chest every which way, hooked up to enough monitors better suited to a moon shot. Bud scratched the calf&#x2019;s forehead and thought, as he often did, that they were such sweet animals.</p><p>Nearby, on a pile of old hospital blankets, was Dr. Daniel Timms, who had been sleeping there all night. A youthful-looking thirty-five-year-old biomedical engineer from Brisbane, Australia, Timms was a slight, tightly wound man with piercing blue eyes and a snaggletooth that, depending on which nurse you asked, made him more or less movie-star handsome. His short brown hair was often tousled, and he always seemed in need of a shave. Daniel wasn&#x2019;t known around the THI for his sense of humor, but the rumors of his genius gave him a pass.</p><p>The calf shifted its weight and Daniel&#x2019;s eyes followed, watching the animal&#x2019;s chest move in and out. Then, reflexively, Daniel&#x2019;s eyes moved to the monitor. It registered the calf&#x2019;s vital signs as completely normal.</p><p>Or rather, completely normal considering that yesterday, in an eight-hour operation, Drs. Frazier and Cohn had sliced out the calf&#x2019;s heart and replaced it with Daniel Timms&#x2019; invention, a device smaller than a tennis ball, that, once stitched in place, took over all the functions of a normal heart. Except, that is, for one thing: the calf had no detectable pulse. One small titanium disc spinning in its housing--at four thousand times a minute--was the only thing keeping this calf alive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2</p><p>How Hard Could It Be?</p><p>Deep in the bowels of the Smithsonian Institution&#x2019;s National Museum of American History is a section of a storeroom with a particular set of drawers. If you go through the proper channels, a friendly curator will let you in and, donning a pair of gloves, open the drawers to reveal some very strange and pretty unappealing-looking devices. Some are made of plastic faded to the color of old chicken broth--though that&#x2019;s a nice way of putting it. Others contain discolored tubes and fabric stained the color of rust, or, more precisely, old blood. Virtually all of them have two parts stuck together--one heart is connected with Velcro. Most have large holes on each side, giving them the look of cockeyed binoculars.</p><p>They do not look like anything a sane person would want stuck inside him- or herself. But in fact these devices represent what has been, for a very long time, the holy grail of medicine: a dependable artificial heart that works on its own inside the body, just like an artificial hip or knee. The cure for cancer runs a very close second to this pursuit, but the fact is, heart disease kills more people around the world than all cancers combined: 17.9 million people or 32 percent of all deaths in 2015. (Three million women in the United States had breast cancer last year, while 12 million had heart disease.) And while these numbers are declining in the developed world, about 26 million Americans currently have heart disease; 2,150 of them die of it each day, an average of one death every forty seconds, or one out of every six deaths in the United States. The number of people who die from heart attacks may have also fallen significantly over the years, thanks to better care and better technology, but now a greater problem is heart failure, a chronic, progressive illness interrupted with life-threatening crises. The American Heart Association&#x2019;s figures show that 5.7 million people suffered from heart failure in the period from 2009 to 2012, but that number jumped to 6.5 million, a 14 percent increase, from 2012 to 2014. Heart transplants have become the solution of choice for disease that is beyond treatment with diet, lifestyle, and medication, but surgeons and their desperate patients know the truth: in any given year there were only 2,500 hearts available for transplant, with about 50,000 people on the waiting list. In other words, there are twenty times more losers than winners.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The Sixty Greatest Conspiracies of All Time: History&#39;s Biggest Mysteries, Coverups, and Cabals</h2><p>The 80 Greatest Conspiracies Of All Time</p><p>Is this book funny in a "1001 Jokes for Toastmasters" kind of way? Certainly not. And if one-hundredth of its contents actually come to pass, I suggest you make plans to move to the moon. Of course, if your sense of humor tends towards the black--as the authors' do--you'll think it's an unmitigated laugh riot. After all, what could be funnier than J. Edgar Hoover in a dress? This book does an excellent job of giving you the background that the <i>X-Files</i> assumes you already have--who are the Pleiadians, and why are they mutilating my cattle? With grim good humor, this book is an excellent primer for a topic that actively resists rational discourse, much less cogency. The authors are funny, witty, and keep a bit of skeptical distance from the topic at hand without dismissing it.</p><h2>Soviet and Russian Military Aircraft in Asia</h2><p>After the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union tried to exert its political influence on the Asian continent. A major pillar of this cold-war policy was the widespread supply of arms to the Continent including many combat, transport, training and utility aircraft. <p><i>Soviet and Russian Military Aircraft in Asia</i> reviews in detail the Soviet and Russian aircraft types used throughout Asia, starting in the 1950s and continuing through to the present day. Each nation is reviewed individually with an overview of the types used, their service record (including combat in conflicts of varying intensities) and extensive tables of individual aircraft with serials, construction numbers, versions and notes. Although the ubiquitous MiG fighters and Mil helicopters feature prominently, there are many other types to consider and aircraft from all the leading design bureaus, including Antonov, Beriyev, Il'yushin, Kamov, Sukhoi, Tupolev and Yakovlev are covered in this book. Chinese 'copies' of Soviet designs are reviewed and also included are those quasi-military and ostensibly civilian transports which have clearly been operated largely on behalf of the military. </p><p><i>Soviet and Russian Military Aircraft in Asia</i> is a treasure trove of exotic colors and markings, combined with a mass of unpublished, original information including over 320 photos, over 140 color profiles and around 50 insignia to delight modelers and fascinate all readers.</p></p><p>Yefim Gordon is one of Russia's leading aviation writers and publishers. He is the author of numerous books on Soviet aviation.<br><br>Dmitriy Komissarov is rapidly establishing himself as a respected authority on Russian and Soviet aviation. He works in the publishing industry and lives in Moscow."This is a very good book! The authors really know their subject and do an excellent job of communicating that knowledge. The photos and color profiles are gorgeous. They illustrate the wild color schemes and lesser-known national markings very well! These alone are a boon to the modeler! They will keep the modeler busy and inspired for years to come! If you have any interest in Soviet/Russian aircraft, the air forces of Asia or military aviation in general, you will want this book!! I strongly recommend this book to all!"

American Assassin </i>was released as a major film in 2017.Enemy of the State <br>CHAPTER 1<br> <br>Above al-Shirqat<br> <br>Iraq<br> <br>MITCH Rapp tried to find a more comfortable position, but none was available. His helmet was jammed against the top of the fuselage and there was something sharp poking through the mesh seat just to the right of his spine.<br> <br>Not exactly the CIA&#x2019;s G550, but then this aircraft hadn&#x2019;t exactly been designed to ferry government VIPs. Its only purpose was the insertion of select teams behind enemy lines, and in order to do that effectively it had to be small, fast, and stealthy. There was no pilot or cockpit, no cabin pressure or heat, and no light other than the dim glow from a computer screen to his right.<br> <br>He glanced over and scanned the data it contained. Four hundred knots at 25,000 feet on a south-by-southeast heading. An infrared map moved lazily beneath the compass and numbers, tracking the ground. Near the bottom of the display, his target began to appear.<br> <br>Al-Shirqat.<br> <br>Despite everything he&#x2019;d lived through&#x2014;everything he&#x2019;d done&#x2014;there were very few places that held memories bad enough to make his palms sweat. In fact, only two. The place his wife had died and �al-Shirqat.<br> <br>A green light over the door flashed and he disconnected his mask from the aircraft&#x2019;s oxygen supply, immediately reattaching it to a low-volume tank on his wingsuit. Slipping out of his chair, he sat on the carbon fiber floor and lashed a small pack between his legs. The countdown had started and he waited until the door began to retract to lower his goggles. The outside air temperature was thirty below zero and it lashed at him as he fought his way to the inky black opening. When the countdown in his earpiece reached zero, he threw himself out, struggling to maintain a stable position as he accelerated into his free fall.<br> <br>After a few seconds he was steady enough to glance at the screen strapped to his wrist. Along with altitude, it indicated direction and horizontal distance to his drop zone. Not that hitting it exactly was all that critical&#x2014;it was a more or less randomly chosen spot about a mile from the edge of the ISIS-controlled city. His old mentor Stan Hurley had beaten precision into him during jump training, though. Rapp could still picture the man standing in the middle of the landing circle, staring skyward.<br> <br>If you don&#x2019;t kick me in my head, I&#x2019;m going to kick the shit out of yours.<br> <br>Who would have thought he&#x2019;d miss the old cuss so much?<br> <br>Everything below him was dark, creating a disorienting sensation of floating in space. Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s former officers were becoming increasingly prominent in ISIS leadership and with their rise came a commensurate improvement in discipline. They&#x2019;d completely blacked out al-Shirqat in an effort to reduce the effectiveness of U.S. bombing runs. Worse, a few mobile SAM units were being moved around the battered streets. Their functionality was unknown, but the knowledge that they were there was enough to prompt him to jump from altitude and come in sideways.<br> <br>He pulled his chute about a thousand feet above the ground, releasing the pack between his legs and letting it drop onto the lanyard connected to him. With a few deft pulls on the chute&#x2019;s toggles, he came down directly on top of the planned target&#x2014;a sandy knoll that offered him the high ground.<br> <br>Rapp gathered the chute quickly and pulled off his goggles and helmet. He lay still for almost two minutes, listening. When he was satisfied that his arrival had gone unnoticed, he stripped down to a grimy pair of jeans and T-shirt, then dragged his pack to him.<br> <br>It didn&#x2019;t contain much more than a shoulder holster with a Glock and silencer, two extra mags, some dried meat, and a shovel to bury everything else. Once done, there was little that would identify him as anything more than a local Iraqi who had been caught in the desert after sunset.<br> <br>Without the screen on his wrist, he was forced to use the stars for navigation. Fortunately, they were just as effective now as they had been when explorers first set out to discover the world. He followed a southerly course, rubbing at his face to remove any marks left by his goggles. Based on weeks of overhead surveillance, he didn&#x2019;t expect to run into any security forces as he entered the city, but there was nothing certain in this business.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>When Rapp reached the bombed-out buildings at the edge of town, he dropped to his stomach again. The men he was there for were farther toward the interior and he mentally reviewed the path through the city laid out by the Agency&#x2019;s cartographers.<br> <br>When he&#x2019;d escaped al-Shirqat last time, he&#x2019;d been posing as an American ISIS recruit. The former Iraqi general controlling the area had devised a plan to use dirty bombs to take out Saudi Arabia&#x2019;s oil-producing capacity, destabilizing the world economy and leaving the Saudis vulnerable to a takeover by Islamic radicals. Rapp had managed to stop the plot, but not without the help of the local resistance.<br> <br>Now the identities of those men had been discovered and ISIS was closing in on them. Most of the people at Langley thought he was crazy to come back, arguing that the risks far outweighed the rewards. And they were probably right. With one exception, the five young men Rapp was there to extract weren&#x2019;t good fighters. None were much use at gathering intelligence, either. Mostly they sat around making long political speeches that the others then heartily agreed with. But when he&#x2019;d needed them, they&#x2019;d stepped up. Fuck if he wouldn&#x2019;t do the same.<br> <br>Unfortunately, that decision had forced him to put a reluctant Joe Maslick in charge of the Rabat, Morocco, operation. In the end, it was probably a good thing. The op wasn&#x2019;t all that complicated and Maslick needed some command experience whether he liked it or not.<br> <br>Rapp closed his eyes for a moment, acknowledging that he was just stalling. He&#x2019;d hoped never to have to return to this place, going so far as to try to convince the military to mount a major assault to take back the city. Predictably, they&#x2019;d pushed back. It wasn&#x2019;t that they didn&#x2019;t think they could do it. With U.S. support, the Iraqi army was strong enough now to recapture it. The problem was that the locals didn&#x2019;t �really see the Iraqi army as much different than ISIS. Just another occupying force to fight an endless guerrilla war against. Welcome to the Middle East.<br> <br>Rapp stood and moved forward, slipping between two buildings and navigating by the light of a full moon. This area of town had taken a lot of battle damage and was largely uninhabited now. He&#x2019;d been through it once before but hadn&#x2019;t bothered to commit it to memory.<br> <br>After about five minutes of generally southern travel, he came to a collapsed building with little more than the east wall surviving. It was one of the landmarks he&#x2019;d identified from a photo at Langley and he turned left, cutting diagonally across a cratered square.<br> <br>By the time he made it to the far side, he was certain he was being tracked. There was a natural rhythm to the debris dislodging from the structures around him and now it was off just enough to stand out. The footfalls were random and careful, but to the practiced ear they were unmistakable.<br> <br>He kept his pace casual, climbing over a burned car to gain access to the alley behind it. When he was certain he was obscured from view, he sidestepped into a gap in the wall to his right.<br> <br>Whoever was behind him was disciplined&#x2014;Rapp would give him that. It was a full two minutes before he was able to pick out an intermittent shadow inching toward his position. He dug a shard of concrete from around a piece of rebar and threw it, creating a nearly inaudible clatter twenty yards to the south.<br> <br>The footsteps faltered for a moment. Rapp retrieved his Glock and waited, barely breathing. A few seconds passed before the silhouette reappeared. The man it belonged to was an inch taller than him and a good six inches wider at the shoulder. He had an assault rifle strapped across his chest and was moving in a manner that suggested he was more than just another ISIS dipshit.<br> <br>Rapp remained motionless in the darkness where he&#x2019;d taken refuge, watching the man approach. When he walked past, Rapp stepped out and pressed his gun to the back of his head.<br> <br>The man didn&#x2019;t cry out or even speak, instead coming to a halt and raising his hands. Rapp moved slowly around him, brushing the barrel of his Glock through the man&#x2019;s hair until it came to rest against his forehead.<br> <br>&#x201c;I remember you being less sloppy,&#x201d; Rapp said in Arabic.<br> <br>&#x201c;And I remember you looking like the wrong end of a goat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp pulled the gun back and the big man embraced him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hold your face to the sky, my friend. Let me see you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp raised his chin to catch the moonlight and the Iraqi gripped Rapp&#x2019;s beard, moving his face around to see better.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s miraculous what you Americans can do,&#x201d; he said sincerely.<br> <br>In order to not be recognized on his prior operation in al-Shirqat, Rapp had been forced to let Joe Maslick beat his face into something resembling raw meat. That was the only face Gaffar had ever seen&#x2014;the broken, bleeding, and swollen one Maslick had created.<br> <br>&#x201c;More surgeries than I care to remember.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, but still . . . it&#x2019;s incredible.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How are the others?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re managing, but they aren&#x2019;t soldiers. Fear is a good motivator, but this . . .&#x201d; He waved a hand around him. &#x201c;The cold, the boredom, the lack of food. It is hard.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long have you been hiding out here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two weeks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp nodded. Often it wasn&#x2019;t the terror and exhaustion of combat that beat people down. It was everything in between.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come,&#x201d; Gaffar said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take you to them.&#x201d;<br> <br>What was left of this part of town appeared to be uninhabited and of no interest to ISIS forces, but still it made sense to proceed carefully. They finally arrived at a massive concrete slab that had tipped against a crumbling wall. Gaffar picked up a rock and tapped it three times against what had once been a lamppost. A moment later the people Rapp had come for appeared at the entrance of the artificial cave.<br> <br>On the left were two thin men who looked like computer geeks. One seemed to have lost his glasses and was squinting uselessly into the darkness. Mohammed, their leader, didn&#x2019;t seem too much worse for the wear and neither did his brother.<br> <br>The Iraqi siblings were the only two men in the world that Rapp had a hard time looking in the eye, so he adjusted his gaze to the woman pressed against Mohammed&#x2019;s side.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s she?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You got married?&#x201d; Rapp said. &#x201c;Interesting sense of timing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shada was being auctioned off by ISIS. I&#x2019;ve known her since we were children. I sold everything I had and used the money to buy her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rapp looked into her dark eyes, taking in the unlined face and black, tangled hair. He had purchased Mohammed&#x2019;s sister under similar circumstances. This girl was younger and more fearful, but otherwise no different than Laleh had been.<br> <br>The memory was accompanied by a painful constriction in Rapp&#x2019;s chest and he pushed her image from his mind. It would come back, though. It always did.<br> <br>&#x201c;If there isn&#x2019;t room for me, I&#x2019;ll stay behind,&#x201d; she said as the silence drew out.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; one of the geeks said, a little too loudly. &#x201c;If anyone is going to stay here, it should be him. He got us into this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shut up!&#x201d; Gaffar said in a harsh whisper. &#x201c;We got ourselves into this. It&#x2019;s our country to fight for. Our people who have destroyed it. Not his.&#x201d;<br> <br>He raised his hand to strike the man, but Rapp caught it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, all you have to do is hold it together for a little longer. Then this&#x2019;ll all be over.&#x201d;<br> <br>He retrieved the food he&#x2019;d brought and divided it among them. &#x201c;Now eat up and gather your gear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then she can come?&#x201d; Mohammed said.<br> <br>Rapp nodded. &#x201c;Five minutes.&#x201d;</p><h2>Life and Work of Henry Scott Tuke</h2><p>, 71 pages, black and white and colour illustrations throughout, index and publishers catalogue in rear</p><p></p><h2>Side Effects</h2><p>Detective Jordan Bishop is tasked with protecting Neela Sahjani, abortion doctor, stem-cell researcher, and member of the new conservative state government a walking contradiction and a complication Jordan can&#x2019;t afford.

The question is: Is Damali's child his&#x2015;or the Chairman's?</p></p><p><p><b>L. A. BANKS</b> is the author of the Vampire Huntress Legend series and the Crimson Moon Novels. She had a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and a master's in fine arts from Temple University. Banks considered herself a shape-shifter. She wrote romance, women's fiction, crime and suspense, and of course, dark vampire huntress lore. She lived with her daughter in an undisclosed lair somewhere in Philadelphia.</p><b>Chapter One</b>&nbsp;La Paz, Mexico&nbsp;Total contentment wafted through Carlos as he sat on a kitchen stool in their honeymoon villa, watching Damali bop around the kitchen. He leaned on his elbows on the wide butcher-block island and smiled. She looked so thoroughly happy and so in her element, buzzing around trying to fix their last private supper, he could only shake his head.&nbsp;The last of the sun was bringing gold and rose-orange light in with the beach breeze from the decks and open windows, dappling the white rooms and Damali's beautiful brown skin. This was sanctuary; the Light had provided a few hallowed days of drama cease-fire and obligation so he could enjoy his new wife. It was a time that he thought would only happen when Hell froze over. Jesus.&nbsp;He silently wondered what their life together would be like with children. After the way they'd been at it for four glorious days and nights, the result was imminent. He smiled and briefly closed his eyes just thinking about it.&nbsp;Oh, yeah, this was a very personal gift from On High. He'd be reverent forever. The way Damali flitted from the counter to the refrigerator to the stove almost choked him up--the sight of it filled him up so. One day her belly would be heavy and loaded with a life they'd created. One day there would be a tiny little face with big brown eyes watching them tease each other and laugh. . . . He just wondered if what they'd make would have fangs or wings or both. He didn't care, as long as he'd made it with her. God apparently did answer prayers.&nbsp;Pineapple and papaya that he was supposed to be peeling sat waiting for him, but try as he might, he couldn't focus on the fruit while he gazed at her. He was just glad that they were on the same wavelength about not wanting to go out for this last honeymoon meal together. Going back to their waiting Guardian team that was family had definitely lost its appeal, too. Although kidnapping her or stopping time to keep life at bay wasn't an option, there was something so private and so profoundly peaceful about this time that he'd tuck it away to savor it beyond the grave. He loved her. Period. End of story.&nbsp;"You don't have to do this, you know," he finally said in a pleasant, mellow tone, just loving the way her white tank top fit her and the way her sheer white sarong hung low on her hips. He watched her unfettered breasts bounce as she moved. He wondered if she had on underwear. There was no visible line of a barrier, and the mystery of it all added to the excitement of watching her work. Did life get any better than this?&nbsp;"I know," she said in a cheerful voice, seeming oblivious to his thoughts; then she stopped to kiss the bridge of his nose across the counter dividing them and went back to her disorganized puttering.&nbsp;"But you're a vegetarian--you don't even eat steak." He laughed and poured them both another glass of merlot as a diversion, to give his hands something to do, rather than grabbing her.&nbsp;"So? I know how to cook one, though."&nbsp;Carlos raised an eyebrow. "Uh . . . you don't really have to cook it all that much for me . . . just a flash on both sides, and--"&nbsp;"Yeah, yeah, I know . . . leave it running blood." Damali sucked her teeth. "I still don't see how you can go there with beef, but I'm not gonna start."&nbsp;They both laughed.&nbsp;"What can I say?" Carlos ran his tongue over the slight hint of fangs that had begun to crest just from the sound of her voice. "Baby, I don't want anything green on my plate, and you don't have to put a bunch of mushrooms and onions and stuff on the steak," he added in protest when she began making him a side salad. "You do the tabouli and hummus, and pita, and rice and beans and all that . . . just--"&nbsp;"Carlos," she fussed. "You're still mostly human and need to eat a balanced meal. Vegetables are good for you."&nbsp;He sighed. "Then go light on the garlic, okay?" His smile widened when she waved her hand at him. "I know all the blood-cleansing properties and what the health food digests say, but truth be told, it still gives me wicked heartburn," he said, laughing hard as she frowned. "Not everything came out of the sunlight straight, and if you smother that steak with that marinade you're concocting, you might as well drag me back to the family house on a livery tonight." He arched an eyebrow again and gave her a sly smile as he began peeling the fruit she'd shoved toward him. "I had other plans . . . but, uh, whatever you fix, I'll eat."&nbsp;She set the small bowl of marinade down hard and chuckled. "Flash it, two seconds on each side--no salt, no pepper, no nothing?"&nbsp;"Au naturel works best for me . . . you know that." He glimpsed her from the corner of his eye, and was rewarded by her brilliant smile.&nbsp;"Fine." She moved to the counter and sipped her wine, keeping the butcher block between them, and then turned back to the stove.&nbsp;As she moved about, all he could envision was the way her white wings would slowly unfold from her shoulders at the height of making love. Her satiny smooth legs peeked out from the sarong each time she pivoted to get something out of the cabinets or the fridge, and her bare feet sounded like a soft sigh. Thank you, God. . . . She was his wife. He could get used to the institution, for sure.&nbsp;He burst out laughing as she pulled the steak out of the broiler, lifted it with a fork and a droll expression, then eased it onto a plate--her eyes saying yuck.&nbsp;"Now do I act like that when I hand you a piece of fruit?" he asked, cutting off a juicy hunk of pineapple and feeding it to her over the counter.&nbsp;"Fruit doesn't run blood, Carlos."&nbsp;"Oh, no? Then what's this?" he said, leaning in toward her and kissing the juice off her chin, totally ignoring the steak between them. "The fruit is bleeding . . . just 'cause it's sweet and almost clear doesn't mean it's not--"&nbsp;"Oh, man! You are ruining pineapple for me forever!" she squealed, wiping her chin with the back of her hand.&nbsp;"Then come over here and sit down and let me make it up to you. Gimme that terrible image . . . and let me work with it," he said, his laughter becoming a low rumble in his chest. "Sun's going down, too . . . sheeit. I'll make pineapple your passion again before the night's over."&nbsp;"Eat your dinner," she argued, playfully escaping his grasp but coming to sit beside him on a blond oak stool. "I went to all this trouble, the least you could do is taste it."&nbsp;"All right, all right," he said resignedly, pulling her into his lap. He kissed her slowly and then looked at her. "I do appreciate everything you've done for me, baby." Closing his eyes, he leaned his forehead against hers. "Bless this food and the one who prepared it. Thank you, God."&nbsp;They sat that way for a moment, her fingers stroking his hair, bare legs and bare feet touching, arms about each other in a loose embrace.&nbsp;"I still can't believe we're married," she whispered as her mouth swept his temple. "You're my husband."&nbsp;"Say it again," he murmured against her ear with his eyes still closed. "I love to hear you say that."&nbsp;"You're my husband," she whispered and nipped his ear. "You're my sexy . . . wonderful, forever husband," she said against his throat, making his embrace tighter as she dotted each word with a kiss. "My . . . husband," she said over his lips, and then pulled back. "So eat."&nbsp;He smiled and opened his eyes, then took her mouth hard.&nbsp;"The steak!" she squealed, laughing as he stood up, toppled the stool, and started walking away from the kitchen with her in his arms.&nbsp;"Oh . . . the steak?" he said, teasing her. "Oh, yes, the bloody steak." He looked at her, making her shake her head and laugh harder. "Decisions, decisions. My wife, or the steak--the steak, or my wife? Her now and microwaved beef later, or the steak now and her reheated later? I don't know, D . . . what should I do?"&nbsp;"In four days and nights, you've practically starved me," she groaned, still giggling. "Just let me get a little bite of something," she said, laughing harder as he tilted his head to offer her his throat. "I mean something that I can digest, Carlos. Remember food? I'm hungry."&nbsp;"Ah . . . the lady says she needs human nourishment for stamina. Okay." He paced back to the kitchen, plopped her down on the counter, and stood in front of their plates, one hand on her thigh.&nbsp;She swallowed a smile, the possessive move to keep her where he'd set her down not lost on her at all. With a mischievous grin, he began feeding her sections of pita dipped in hummus and seemed to revel in the way she slowly cut his steak and offered him a bite of it on his fork. This was heaven. She loved when he got that devastated expression in his eyes. But he shook his head.&nbsp;"Why not?" She pouted, disappointed that he wouldn't try the steak, and she looked at him hard then at the cut meat, wondering what was wrong with it.&nbsp;He smiled wider. "Take it off the silver and feed it to me au naturel . . . use your fingers."&nbsp;"Oh," she said with a grin.&nbsp;"Now that's good," he said in a sensual rumble, pulling the juicy meat from her fingers and sucking her index finger and thumb. "Way better. I think I...</p><h2>Saint Francis of Assisi</h2><p><b><i>The most insightful book about Francis of Assisi&#x2014;ever. </i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideal for gift-giving, this beautiful edition offers all of G. K. Chesterton&#x2019;s insight, humor, and wit as he uncovers the real meaning of the life of the world&#x2019;s most popular saint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samples from this classic book:&nbsp;<i>All [Francis&#x2019;s] life was a series of plunges and scampers; darting after the beggar, dashing naked into the woods, tossing himself into the strange ship, hurling himself into the Sultan&#x2019;s tent and offering to hurl himself into the fire. In appearance he must have been like a thin brown skeleton autumn leaf dancing eternally before the wind; but in truth it was he that was the wind.</i>&nbsp;<i>The conversion of St. Francis involved his being in some sense flung suddenly from a horse. There was not a rag of him left that was not ridiculous. Everybody knew that at the best he had made a fool of himself. The word fool itself began to shine and change.</i></p><p>There are certainly many studies of Saint Francis of Assisi that an interested reader might find and many of them immensely praiseworthy. But in reading G.K. Chesterton on Francis, you get two glories for one: first is an enlightening study of this most beloved of Christian saints and second is Chesterton himself, one of the great Christian writers of the 20th century, who converted to Roman Catholicism in 1922 because, it has been said, "only the Roman Church could produce a St. Francis of Assisi." Published shortly after his conversion, Chesterton wrote this book in part to reclaim Francis for the church. There are always those who want to claim Francis for their cause, Chesterton recognized, who also fail to understand the spiritual and intellectual ground upon which he stands. Chesterton would return Francis to Christ. As he summarizes, "however wild and romantic his gyrations might appear to many, [Francis] always hung on to reason by one invisible and indestructible hair.... The great saint was sane.... He was not a mere eccentric because he was always turning towards the center and heart of the maze; he took the queerest and most zigzag shortcuts through the wood, but he was always going home." <p> As one editor of Chesterton's puts it, "of St. Francis he might have said what he said about Blake: 'We always feel that he is saying something very plain and emphatic even when we have not the wildest notion of what it is.'" <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Francis of Assisi is, after Mary of Nazareth, the greatest saint in the Christian calendar, and one of the most influential men in the whole of human history. By universal acclaim, this biography by G. K. Chesterton is considered the best appreciation of Francis's life--the one that gets to the heart of the matter.<p></p><p>For Chesterton, Francis is a great paradoxical figure, a man who loved women but vowed himself to chastity; an artist who loved the pleasures of the natural world as few have loved them, but vowed himself to the most austere poverty, stripping himself naked in the public square so all could see that he had renounced his worldly goods; a clown who stood on his head in order to see the world aright. Chesterton gives us Francis in his world-the riotously colorful world of the High Middle Ages, a world with more pageantry and romance than we have seen before or since. Here is the Francis who tried to end the Crusades by talking to the Saracens, and who interceded with the emperor on behalf of the birds. Here is the Francis who inspired a revolution in art that began with Giotto and a revolution in poetry that began with Dante. Here is the Francis who prayed and danced with pagan abandon, who talked to animals, who invented the creche.</p></p><h2>Yamaha Racing Motorcycles: All Factory and Production Road-Racing Two-Strokes from 1955 to 1993</h2><p>The full story of the racing two-strokes, from the companys fateful decision to go into motorcycle racing in 1954, right up to the 199s and the powerful machines being produced today.

The meaningful distinction today is not between Protestant and Catholic, or Baptist and Episcopalian, but rather between "legalistic" and "nonlegalistic" religion, between the Church of Law and the Church of Love. On one side is the fundamentalist right, which draws a sharp distinction between "saved" and "unsaved" and worships a God of wrath and judgment; on the other are more mainstream Christians who view all humankind as children of a loving God who calls them to break down barriers of hate, prejudice, and distrust.<br><br>Pointing out that the supposedly "traditional" beliefs of American fundamentalism--about which most mainstream Christians, clergy included, know shockingly little--are in fact of relatively recent origin, are distinctively American in many ways, and are dramatically at odds with the values that Jesus actually spread, Bawer fascinatingly demonstrates the way in which these beliefs have increasingly come to supplant genuinely fundamental Christian tenets in the American church and to become synonymous with Christianity in the minds of many people.<br><br><b>Stealing Jesus</b> is the ringing testament of a man who is equally disturbed by the notion of an America without Christianity and the notion of an American Christianity without love and compassion.</p><p>In 300-odd pages, Bruce Bawer has opened a floodgate of incisive religious criticism that will reverberate across the American political scene. He has put into eloquent and decisive language what many mainline Christians and non-Christians have quietly suspected but been unable to verbalize--namely that Fundamentalist Christianity is barely Christian at all. A Baptist theologian says he is &#34;not interested in who Jesus was.&#34; Pat Robertson argues the Golden Rule as Jesus&#39;s justification that &#34;individual self-interest is being a very real part of the human makeup, and something not necessarily bad or sinful.&#34; In page after page, Bawer reveals a so-called Fundamentalist movement that readily displays a blatant disregard for the most salient message of the Gospels: selfless love and service to all. As for the significance of this revelation in the face of the ballooning presence of Fundamentalist Christians in American politics, readers will have to decide for themselves.Praise for Stealing Jesus:<br><br>"In this book Bruce Bawer emerges as one of this nation's premier religious commentators. One by one he parades the leaders of America's Religious Right--Falwell, Robertson, Reed, Dobson--before our eyes, and without rancor or hostility makes his readers listen to their own words. The result is a new, fascinating insight into the ways in which human prejudice and hostility masquerade under pious rhetoric. Bawer's own background as a practicing Christian gives this volume a disarming brilliance."<br>-The Right Reverend John Shelby Spong, author of Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes and Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism<br><br>"American fundamentalism has successfully passed itself off as authentic Christianity, both among its adherents and among the more secular part of the American public. Actually, it bears little relationship to the message proclaimed by Jesus; in fact, it embodies the very attitudes Jesus attacks. In Stealing Jesus, Bruce Bawer pulls back the curtain on the origins and meaning of this curious and pervasive piece of American mythology. What he has produced is a good read--and a story of great importance in our increasingly religious age."<br>-L.William Countryman, Professor of New Testament, The Church Divinity School of the Pacific, and author of The Mystical Way in the Fourth Gospel, Good News of Jesus, and other books<br><br>"Christianity is a way of life, larger and far richer than simplistic black and white rules for living.

At first it fell in big, fat, wet flakes that disappeared almost as soon as they hit the ground; later in the afternoon, as temperatures fell, they became small and hard, and so began to stick.The storm was from the northwest, made pregnant by the evaporation from the warm north Pacific current; its moisture-laden airstream rose over the masses of the Olympic Peninsula, where the colder air awaiting atop the peaks froze the evaporation into ice crystals, which hung in the air, growing heavier by the hour. The wind drove the crystals southeast across the southwest corner of the state of Washington, toward the Columbia River and then, in a carom shot off Oregon's share of the Coast Range, due east toward Portland. Heavy snow and rain shut down Portland International Airport that afternoon, and soon forced closures of the major highway arteries to the east.Visibility was reduced to almost nothing on Interstate 5, the main north-south connector between Portland and Seattle. By dusk on Sunday, January 11, 1998, the snowstorm assaulted Centralia, Washington, eighty miles or so north of Portland, with almost a foot of whiteness, tying up all the local roads in the process.Early the next morning, the winds shifted with increasing strength from the northwest to the west, and the snow and ice directed its attention to the Puget Sound area. By the afternoon of January 12, the white fallout had reached a depth of three inches in Seattle--a huge amount for a major urban area unaccustomed to significant snow. The accompanying cold led to a frozen fire hydrant near Tacoma, which in turn prevented a fire crew from extinguishing a blaze in a six-unit apartment building, which then burned to to the ground. Cars smashed into pile-ups from Olympia to south Seattle, and almost every road was decorated with the carcasses of stranded automobiles that had spun out on the ice before lurching into the parallel drainage ditches which accompanied almost every road in the region.A man in Tukwila, a suburb south of Seattle, was killed when his pickup truck lost control and swerved in front of a tractor-trailer rig; a 12-year-old boy was seriously hurt when the sled he was riding lost control and slewed into oncoming traffic.At the University of Washington, frat boys pelted each other with wet snowballs, and the police were called out to make sure that everyone kept as cool as the weather.&nbsp;<br>That same afternoon, the small town of Port Angeles, Washington--about 19,000 people, well-established on the south side of the massive strait of Juan de Fuca, some seventy miles west-northwest of Seattle and about eighteen miles across the water from Victoria, British Columbia--finally got its own taste of the snow that had tied up the rest of the region for the previous twenty-four hours.Ordinarily, Port Angeles and the northern Olympic Peninsula of Clallam County missed most of the region's worst weather; the majestic Olympic Mountains usually acted as a barrier to the winter storms, and the warm current running into the strait from the Pacific helped keep temperatures north of the Olympic peaks above freezing for most of the year.As a result, snow in Port Angeles was rare, far more rare than in inland locations like Seattle and Portland.But based on the weatherpeople's predictions, authorities in Port Angeles knew they could expect to receive a substantial snowfall that afternoon; with plummeting temperatures and the Pacific storm hanging up on the crags of the mountains, more than a few inches of white could be expected to fall throughout the afternoon and evening. The Clallam County road crew started spreading sand along the roads that morning, in preparation for forecasts of unusually slick driving conditions.By late afternoon, Port Angeles Police and Clallam County sheriff's deputies were overwhelmed with calls about minor fender-benders and incapacitated vehicles; one woman in a pickup was run over by a log truck as she tried to enter the main highway east of town, and had to be cut out of the squashed wreck.By 4:45 p.m., the sun had finally set, even as obscured by clouds as it had been for several days, and the city of Port Angeles was plunged into its usual mid-winter darkness, while the snowfall grew ever stronger. After-school activities were cancelled, and many people rushed to the supermarkets to lay in supplies of food and other necessities in case the storm persisted.&nbsp;<br>From his own offices at the Peninsula Children's Clinic, across the street from Olympic Memorial Hospital, Dr. Eugene Turner watched the snow come down and tried to decide what to do.That afternoon, he'd been scheduled to go ice-skating with a disadvantaged 14-year-old boy. That was the sort of thing Gene Turner did with his own time: getting involved with people who needed more than he did.At 62, Dr. Turner was a legend; an Olympian, as it were, among the people of Clallam County. A pediatrician, the genial, sandy-haired doctor was said to have delivered as many as a third of the babies born on the Olympic Peninsula over the previous three decades.Before that, he'd volunteered for the Peace Corps. In his off hours in Port Angeles, he cut wood for poor families, or volunteered for any number of good works. Turner had provided funds for Habitat for Humanity's first housing unit in Port Angeles, and had helped with its construction. His clinic even picked up the trash along a stretch of Highway 101, the main highway leading into town, and Gene Turner usually did it himself.Around 5 p.m. Dr. Turner took a telephone call from his wife, Norma, a mover and shaker in her own right among the cognoscenti of Clallam County. Dr. Turner reminded Norma that he'd promised to take a boy ice-skating that afternoon.But what about the weather? Norma asked. With all the snow, maybe Gene should postpone the outing, she suggested.From his clinic window, across from Olympic Memorial Hospital, Turner glanced at the slate-gray sky, the darkening horizon and the increasing snow. He knew Norma was right. He cancelled the skating session and headed toward home, a few miles south into the foothills overlooking Port Angeles.&nbsp;<br>Even as Dr. Eugene Turner was making his way home, another family was settling in for the night of the storm. Martin and Michelle McInnerney had been married for less than a year; on the Friday before the storm Michelle had given birth to the couple's first child, Conor Shamus McInnerney. After spending Friday and Saturday at Olympic Memorial Hospital in Port Angeles, Michelle and Conor had been released to the couple's modest house on South Pine Street in the western portion of Port Angeles.On the Monday following, at the height of the storm, they were visited by a close friend of Marty's, Byron Sifford.The McInnerneys were young--she was 20, he was 22. Sifford was also young. They were representative of muchof the population of Port Angeles: children of blue-collar workers who had labored for generations in the town's preeminent industries: lumber, paper and fish, the backbone of the town's economy--much of which had been decimated over the previous decade by dwindling timber resources and declining fish runs. Indeed, both Marty and Michelle had been marginally employed in the recent past, and their immediate economic future appeared bleak.Sifford had worked with Marty when both were teenagers, and they had become friends. Later, he, Marty and Michelle had shared a house in Port Angeles. After spending some time in Oregon, Sifford had returned to Port Angeles and renewed his acquaintance with the couple. Married, with a child of his own, Sifford nevertheless spent a considerable amount of time with the McInnerneys.On this Monday, in fact, Sifford dropped by the McInnerneys' house to show them a board game he had been given for a recent birthday. As the snows continued, the three set up the game and began to roll the dice to play.Infant Conor was initially sitting in a child's swing. Sifford noticed that the baby seemed slightly agitated, but Michelle picked him up and walked him around to calm him, as Sifford later put it. A bit after that, Conor seemed hungry, so Michelle began to breast-feed him, even as all three continued the game. Michelle reclined on a couch while feeding the baby, and Marty and Byron rolled for her.After a few minutes of this, Sifford noticed that Conor "started getting a little fussy."Sifford asked Michelle what the trouble was, and Michelle told him that Conor wasn't yet quite proficient at breast-feeding. After a few minutes, Conor "quieted down," Sifford said later, and Sifford thought nothing more of it. The three kept playing the game, according to Sifford, with Michelle continuing to recline on the couch, tending the infant.A few minutes after Conor had quieted, Michelle noticed that something was not right."Is he breathing?" she asked.Sifford stopped focusing on the board game. He looked at Michelle and her baby and noticed that Conor wasn't moving. He knew something was dreadfully wrong.Copyright � 2000 by Carlton Smith.</p><h2>Show Jumping (Threshold Picture Guides)</h2><p>Straightforward advice on correct technique for riding show jumping fences and courses successfully.

She received a doctorate in creative writing from Princeton and a master&#39;s degree in education from Harvard.Chapter One: Jane<br><br>The night before I got married I woke up, screaming, from my sleep. My parents came into the room and put their arms around me; they patted my head and smoothed my hair, fine, and I still couldn't stop screaming. Even with my mouth closed, I continued -- the high, shrill note of a nocturnal animal.<br><br>My parents were beside themselves. We lived in a button-down suburb of Boston, and we were waking up the neighbors one by one. I watched the lights come on in different houses -- blue and yellow, blinking like Christmas -- and wondered what was happening to me.<br><br>This wasn't a common occurrence. I was barely nineteen, a straight-A student fresh out of Wellesley College and in 1976 that was still an accomplishment. I was marrying the man of my dreams in a prototypical white clapboard New England church, and the reception -- a lavish one with white-gloved waiters and Beluga caviar -- was going to be held in my parents' backyard. I had a job waiting for me when I returned from my honeymoon. There was no foreseeable problem that I could articulate.<br><br>To this day, I don't know why that happened to me. As mysteriously as it all started, the screaming went away and the next morning I married Oliver Jones -- <i>the</i> Oliver Jones -- and we just about lived happily ever after.<br><br>I am the only speech pathologist in this town, which means I get shuttled back and forth to different elementary schools in the San Diego suburbs. It's not such a big deal now that Rebecca is old enough to take care of herself, and since Oliver is away so much of the time, I have less to do at home. I enjoy my work but certainly not the way Oliver enjoys his work. Oliver would be content to live in a sailcloth tent on the coast of Argentina, watching his whales sound in warm water.<br><br>My job is to help children find their voices -- kinds that come to school mute, or with lisps or cleft palates. At first, they come into my little makeshift classroom one at a time and they shuffle their Keds on the floor and shyly glance at the formidable recording equipment and they are absolutely silent. Sometimes I stay silent too, until the student breaks the ice and asks what he or she is supposed to do. Some students cover their mouths with their hands at this point; I have even seen one little girl cry: they cannot stand to hear their own voices, pieces of themselves that they have been told are ugly. My role is to show them there's someone who is ready to listen to what they have to say and the way they have to say it.<br><br>When I was seven, I tell these kids, I used to whistle every time I said the letter S. In school I got teased and because of this I did not have many friends and I did not talk very much. One day my teacher told the class we'd be putting on a play and that everyone had to participate. I was so nervous about reading aloud in front of everyone else that I pretended I was sick. I faked a fever by holding the thermometer up to a light bulb when my mother left the room. I was allowed to stay home for three days, until my teacher called, and my mother figured out what I was doing. When I went back to school, my teacher called me aside. All of the parts had been taken in the play, she said, but she had saved a special role for me, offstage. I was going to be the Manager of Sound Effects, just like in the movies. I practiced with my teacher every day after school for three weeks. In time I discovered I could become a fire engine, a bird, a mouse, a bee, and many other things because of my lisp. When the night of the play came, I was given a black robe and a microphone. The other students got to be just one part, but I became the voice of several animals and machines. And my father was so proud of me; it was the only time I remember him telling me so.<br><br>That's the story I give at those Coastal Studies cocktail parties Oliver and I go to. We rub shoulders with people who'll give grant money. We introduce ourselves as Dr. and Dr. Jones, although I'm still ABD. We sneak out when everyone is going to sit down to the main course, and we run to the car and make fun of people's sequined dresses and dinner jackets. Inside, I curl up against Oliver as he drives, and I listen to him tell me stories I have heard a million times before -- about an era when you could spot whales in every ocean.<br><br>In spite of it all, there's just <i>something</i> about Oliver. You know what I'm talking about -- he was the first man who truly took my breath away, and sometimes he still can. He's the one person I feel comfortable enough with to share a home, a life, a child. He can take me back fifteen years with a smile. In spite of differences, Oliver and I have Oliver and I.<br><br>In this one school where I spend Tuesdays, my office is a janitorial closet. Sometime after noon the secretary of the school knocks on the door and tells me Dr. Jones is on the phone. Now this is truly a surprise. Oliver is at home this week, putting together some research, but he usually has neither the time nor the inclination to call me. He never asks what school I head to on a given day. "Tell him I'm with a student," I say, and I push the play button on my tape recorder. Vowel sounds fill the room: <i>AAAAA EEEEEIIIII.</i> I know Oliver too well to play his games. <i>OOOOO UUUUU.</i> Oh, you. Oh, you.<br><br>Oliver is Very Famous. He wasn't when we met, but today he is one of the leading researchers of whales and whale behavior. He has made discoveries that have rocked the scientific world. He is so well known that people take pictures of our mailbox, as if to say, "I've been to the place where Dr. Jones lives." Oliver's most important research has been on whale songs. It appears that whole groupings of whales sing the same ones -- Oliver has recorded this -- and pass the songs down over generations. I don't understand much about his work, but that is just as much my fault as Oliver's. He never tells me about the ideas burning in his mind anymore, and I sometimes forget to ask.<br><br>Naturally Oliver's career has come first. He moved us to California to take a job with the San Diego Center for Coastal Studies, only to find out East Coast humpbacks were his true passion. The minute I got to San Diego I wanted to leave, but I didn't tell Oliver that. For better or for worse, I had said. Oliver got to fly back to Boston and I stayed here with an infant, in a climate that is always summer, that never smells like snow.<br><br>I'm not taking his phone call.<br><br>I'm not taking this again, period.<br><br>It is one thing for me to play second fiddle; it is another thing to see it happen to Rebecca. At fourteen she has the ability to take a survey of her life from a higher vantage point -- an ability I haven't mastered at thirty-five -- and I do not believe she likes what she is seeing. When Oliver is home, which is rare, he spends more time in his study than with us. He doesn't take an interest in anything that isn't tied to the seas. The way he treats me is one matter: we have a history; I hold myself accountable for falling in love in the first place. But Rebecca will not take him on faith, just because he is her father. Rebecca expects.<br><br>I've heard about teenagers who run away, or get pregnant or drop out of school, and I have heard these things linked to problems at home. So I offered Oliver an ultimatum. Rebecca's fifteenth birthday next week coincides with Oliver's planned visit to a humpback breeding ground off the coast of South America. Oliver intends to go. I told him to be here.<br><br>What I wanted to say is: This is your daughter. Even if we have grown so far apart that we don't recognize each other when we pass, we have this life, this block of time, and what do you think about that?<br><br>One reason I keep my mouth shut is Rebecca's accident. It was the result of a fight with Oliver, and I've been doing my best to keep something like that from happening again. I don't remember what that argument was about, but I gave him a piece of my mind and he hit me. I picked up my baby (Rebecca was three and a half at the time) and flew to my parents. I told my mother I was going to divorce Oliver; he was a lunatic and on top of this he'd hit me. Oliver called and said he didn't care what I did but I had no right to keep his daughter. He threatened legal action. So I took Rebecca to the airport and told her, "I'm sorry, honey, but I can't stand that man." I bribed a stewardess with a hundred dollars to take her on the plane, and it crashed in Des Moines. The next thing I knew I was standing in a farmer's cornfield, watching the wreckage smoke. It still seemed to be moving. The wind sang through the plane's limbs, voices I couldn't place. And behind me was Rebecca, singed but intact, one of five survivors, curled in her father's arms. She has Oliver's yellow hair and freckles. Like him, she's beautiful. Oliver and I looked at each other and I knew right then why fate had made me fall in love with a man like Oliver Jones: some combination of him and of me had created a child who could charm even unyielding earth.<br><br>Copyright � 1992 by Jodi Picoult</p><h2>The Danger</h2><p>Andrew Douglas works for a company specializing in returning kidnap victims to their families.

He enlisted almost immediately and served in the American Expeditionary Forces until his discharge in 1919. <i>An American Soldier in World War I</i> is an edited collection of more than one hundred letters that Browne wrote to his fianc�e, Martha &#x201c;Marty&#x201d; Johnson, describing his experiences during World War I as part of the famed 42nd, or Rainbow, Division. From September 1917 until he was wounded in the Meuse-Argonne offensive in late October 1918, Browne served side by side with his comrades in the 117th Engineering Regiment. He participated in several defensive actions and in offensives on the Marne, at Saint-Mihiel, and in the Meuse-Argonne.</p><p>This extraordinary collection of Brownie&#x2019;s letters reveals the day-to-day life of an American soldier in the European theater. The difficulties of training, transportation to France, dangers of combat, and the ultimate strain on George and Marty&#x2019;s relationship are all captured in these pages. David L. Snead weaves the Browne correspondence into a wider narrative about combat, hope, and service among the American troops. By providing a description of the experiences of an average American soldier serving in the American Expeditionary Forces in France, this study makes a valuable contribution to the history and historiography of American participation in World War I.</p></p><p>David L.

Its frame of analysis is absorbed with historical transitions: from the end of the postcolonial utopias of the sixties during the 1980s to the geopolitical, economic, technological, and cultural shifts incited by globalization. This book is both narrower in focus in the periods it reflects on, and specific in the ground it covers. It begins by addressing the tumultuous landscape of contemporary Africa, examining landmarks and narratives, exploring divergent systems of representation, and interrogating the ways artists have responded to change and have incorporated new aesthetic principles and artistic concepts, images and imaginaries to deal with such changes. Organized in chronological order, the book covers all major artistic mediums: painting, sculpture, photography, film, video, installation, drawing, collage. It also covers aesthetic forms and genres, from conceptual to formalist, abstract to figurative practices. Moving between discursive and theoretical registers, the principal questions the book analyzes are: what and when is contemporary African art? Who might be included in the framing of such a conceptual identity? It also addresses the question of globalization and contemporary African art.<br>The book thus provides an occasion to examine through close reading and visual analysis how artistic concerns produce major themes. It periodizes and cross references artistic sensibilities in order to elicit multiple conceptual relationships, as well as breaks with prevailing binaries of center and periphery, vernacular and academic, urban and non-urban forms, indigenous and diasporic models of identification. In order to theorize how these concerns have been formulated in artistic terms and their creative consequences <i>Contemporary African Art Since 1980</i> examines a range of ideas, concepts and issues that have shaped the work and practice of African artists within an international and global framework. It traces the shifts from earlier modernist strategies of the sixties and seventies after the period of decolonization, and the rise of pan-African nationalism, to the postcolonial representations of critique and satire that evolved from the 1980s, to the postmodernist irony of the 1990s, and to the globalist strategies of the 21st century.<br>The main claim of this book is that contemporary African art can be best understood by examining the tension between the period of great political changes of the era of decolonization that enabled new and exciting imaginations of the future to be formulated, and the slow, skeptical, and social decline marked by the era of neo-liberalism and Structural Adjustment programs of the 1980s. These issues are addressed in chapters covering the themes of &#x201c;Politics, Culture, Critique,&#x201d; &#x201c;Memory and Archive,&#x201d; &#x201c;Abstraction, Figuration and Subjectivity,&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Body, Gender and Sexuality.&#x201d; In addition, the book employs sidebars to provide brief and incisive accounts of and commentaries on important contemporary political, economic and cultural events, and on exhibitions, biennales, workshops, artist groups and more. Rather than a comprehensive survey, this richly illustrated book presents examples of ambitious and important work by more than 160 African artists since the last 30 years. This list includes Georges Adeagbo Tayo Adenaike, Ghada Amer, El Anatsui, Kader Attia, Luis Basto, Candice Breitz, Moustapha Dim�, Marlene Dumas, Victor Ekpuk, Samuel Fosso, Jak Katarikawe, William Kentridge, Rachid Koraichi, Mona Mazouk, Julie Mehretu, Nandipha Mntambo, Hassan Musa, Donald Odita, Iba Ndiaye, Richard Onyango, Ibrahim El Salahi, Issa Samb, Cheri Samba, Ousmane Sembene, Yinka Shonibare, Barthelemy Toguo, Obiora Udechukwu, and Sue Williamson.<br><b>Okwui Enwezor</b>, a leading curator and scholar of contemporary art, is the Dean of Academic Affairs at the San Francisco Art Institute, and founding publisher and editor of Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art.<br><b>Chika Okeke-Agulu</b> is Assistant Professor of Art and Archeology and African American Studies at Princeton University, and editor of Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art.</p><p></p><h2>Friends at the Table: The Ultimate Supper Club Cookbook</h2><p><i>Friends at the Table </i>shows how to take the elements of supper clubs gone by and re-create them in an evening of fine dining at home, without the expense of a restaurant.

In six days, Max Silverskin, thief and trickster, must discover the secrets of his heritage or die from the witch mark &#x2013; the silverheart &#x2013; which will devour his heart. Lady Rose Iron, daughter of the leader of the powerful Clan Iron is thrown into an edgy alliance with Max as she searches for the secrets that could save the city&#x2019;s future. Captain Cornelius Coffin, head of the clans&#x2019; security forces, is in love with Lady Rose and obsessed with capturing Max. And there are others, in Shriltasi, Karadur&#x2019;s underworld twin, who know the prophecy which says that only Max Silverskin can save both realms. In Silverheart, Michael Moorcock and Storm Constantine have combined their talents to produce a novel that is both surreal and gothic.</p><p>Born in 1939, Michael Moorcock is a highly respected author who has won many awards over his prolific career. His novella Behold the Man won the Nebula Award. He is also the recipient of the World Fantasy Award and the British Fantasy Award, among others. Currently he resides in Texas, with wife, Linda. Storm Constantine has written over twenty books, both fiction and nonfiction, and well over fifty short stories. Her novels span several genres, from literary fantasy, to science fiction, to dark fantasy. She is most well known for her Wraeththu trilogy (omnibus edition published by Tor) and has recently completed a new set of novels set in the world of Wraeththu, concluding with The Ghosts of Blood and Innocence (Tor, 2005, USA; Immanion Press, 2005, UK). Storm is also cofounder of the small publishing house Immanion Press, created in order to get classic titles from established writers back in print and innovative new authors an audience. She&#x2019;s currently working on several ideas for new books, as well as reading and editing a far too large pile of manuscripts for other writers. She lives in the Midlands of England, with her husband, Jim, and eight cats.Inflated by Constantine (<i>Wraeththu</i>) from Nebula Award&#x2013;winner Moorcock's original manuscript, this adjunct to Moorcock's fictional "multiverse" tracks along predictable quest-for-the-icons-to-save-the-world lines. Both the industrial city of Karadur and its separated, underworld twin, Shriltasi, are decaying, and engaging master thief and hero-in-hiding Max Silverskin has six days to unite them so both can survive. Muzzy magic, inane sewer-crawls, posturing rulers and limp villains dilute the message that humanity had better balance reason with magic. To its near disaster, Karadur is ruled by the Lords of Metal&#x2014;unyielding, stiff and flat. Unfortunately, so is this fantasy novel. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

After a restless childhood on New York&#x2019;s Long Island, she left America to see Europe and the Near East, a young artist plunging into unfamiliar cultures, notebook always in hand, drawing what she observed.</p><p>Returning to New York City just before 9/11 to study art, she posed nude for sketch artists and sketchy photographers, danced burlesque, and modeled for the world-famous Suicide Girls. Frustrated with the academy and the conventional art world, she eventually landed a post as house artist at Simon Hammerstein&#x2019;s legendary nightclub the Box, the epicenter of decadent Manhattan nightlife before the financial crisis of 2008. There she had a ringside seat for the pitched battle between the bankers of Wall Street and the entertainers who walked among them&#x2014;a scandalous, drug-fueled circus of mutual exploitation that she captured in her tart and knowing illustrations. Then, after the crash, a wave of protest movements&#x2014;from student demonstrations in London to Occupy Wall Street in her own backyard&#x2014;led Molly to turn her talents to a new form of witness journalism, reporting from places such as Guant�namo, Syria, Rikers Island, and the labor camps of Abu Dhabi. Using both words and artwork to shed light on the darker corners of the American empire, she has swiftly become one of the most original and galvanizing voices on the cultural stage.</p><p>Now, with the same blend of honesty, fierce insight, and indelible imagery that is her signature, Molly offers her own story: an unforgettable memoir of artistic exploration, political awakening, and personal transformation.</p><p>Molly Crabapple is an artist and writer.

As a result, the scores of clandestine paramilitary cells that flourished in the aftermath of Ruby Ridge and Waco formed a loosely knit underground network with a shared goal to violently overthrow the U.S. government. This gripping volume explores one of the most dangerous of those phantom cells-the Aryan Republican Army (ARA). Based on trial transcripts, interviews, a secret diary, newspaper accounts, and ethnographic research, Mark S. Hamm provides a compelling history of the ARA, its organizers, and the revolutionary group&#39;s significance in supporting acts of domestic terrorism, including its previously unrecognized role in Timothy McVeigh&#39;s devastating bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. He interweaves his narrative with a penetrating discussion of why people like McVeigh and the ARA members turn hatred into terrorist actions. Hamm centers his riveting account of the ARA on the troubled life histories of founders Peter Kevin McGregor Langan and Richard &#34;Wild Bill&#34; Guthrie, as well as on profiles of the foot soldiers in the movement. He explores the similar social, cultural, and personal forces that attracted these men to the White Supremacy movement and Christian Identity, a theology that gives the blessing of God to the racist cause, and that drove them on a criminal path to terrorism. Drawing historical parallels with the motives and tactics of Jesse James and his gang&#39;s crime spree, Hamm focuses on how Langan and his paramilitary gang committed a string of professionally executed armed bank robberies to finance the overthrow of the federal government through such terrorist attacks as train derailments, assassinations, and bombings. Hamm concludes this absorbing yet disconcerting journey through America&#39;s underground terrorist conspiracy by challenging the government&#39;s assertion that Timothy McVeigh acted as a lone wolf in the Oklahoma City bombing. Instead, he offers startling new evidence that connects McVeigh to the Aryan Republican Army.</p><p>Mark S. Hamm is Professor of Criminology at Indiana State University. He is the author of American Skinheads: The Criminology and Control of Hate Crime, The Abandoned Ones: The Imprisonment and Uprising of the Mariel Boat People, and Apocalypse in Oklahoma: Waco and Ruby Ridge Revenged, and the coeditor of Ethnography on the Edge: Crime, Deviance, and Field Research.With the roots and trappings of terrorism at the forefront of national consciousness, Hamm's study of domestic terrorism is especially timely. Hamm (Apocalypse in Oklahoma), a criminology professor at Indiana State University, offers a detailed look at the Aryan Republican Army (ARA), a radical right cell that he suspects actively assisted Timothy McVeigh. Based upon information from shared acquaintances, a reconstruction of McVeigh's movements in the months preceding the bombing and other circumstantial evidence, Hamm theorizes that the mysterious "John Doe 2" allegedly seen with McVeigh on the day of the bombing may have been an ARA member. These disaffected racists cast themselves, not unlike McVeigh, as patriots battling a corrupt federal government. Hamm interviewed the group's principal leader, Pete Langan, at length in prison, where he is serving a life sentence, and the account is based largely on his perspective. The colorful Langan took a few ideologically warped young men and led them on 22 successful bank robberies. Not your run-of-the-mill right-wing radical, Langan is a pre-operative transsexual. Hamm perceives sublimated homoerotic undercurrents among these neo-Nazis; Langan hid his sexuality from his gun-toting cohorts. He now blames his criminal actions on "`gender dysphoria.'" Despite Hamm's compelling perspective on right-wing subculture, his central theory that the ARA actively participated in the Oklahoma bombing is less than fully convincing, based as it is on only circumstantial evidence. Regardless, and despite the overlong, overly simplistic psychological portrait of Langan, the book will interest readers seeking more information about this violent subculture.

Viktor Chemayev is the Philip Marlowe of Russian detectives, a sad-eyed, heavy drinking romantic who refuses to stay beat. In the title novella of this extraordinary collection, he goes head-to-head with an Irish assassin in the depths of a Moscow nightclub in an attempt to win back his true love, who has been sold to the Beelzebub-like king of the Moscow underworld... Lucius Shepard is known for his dark, unpredictable vision, and in this assemblage of some of his best writing he takes us from Moscow to Africa; from the mountains of Iraq, where Specialist Charlie N. Wilson encounters a very different sort of enemy, to Central America, where a bloody-handed colonel meets his doom via lizards. In these seven tales Shepard&#39;s imagination spans the globe and, like an American Gabriel Garcia Marquez, refuses to be restricted by mere reality.</p><p>Ranging in locale from the ruins at ground zero to war-torn contemporary Iraq and a civil war&#x2013;ridden corner of a nameless African republic, Shepard's haunting, structurally perfect stories in his latest collection serve as a veritable travel guide to geographic hot spots of tragedy and trauma and the horrors they spawn. In "Only Partly Here," a young man cleaning up the site of the World Trade Center collapse finds direction in his life through a relationship with an enigmatic woman who haunts downtown Manhattan and reveals herself to be a lost soul of a different type. "Eternity and Afterwards" tells of a Russian gangster whose navigation through the occult recesses of a sprawling nightclub captures the Byzantine realities of his country. Shepard (<i>A Handbook of American Prayer</i>) manages a perfect meshing of details that bring the imagined backdrops of these tales to vivid life with the psychological and emotional lives of his characters. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With gentle humor and clear-eyed affection the author, who grew up to become a college president, tells the story of her first encounters with the &#34;glittering world&#34; and her desire for &#34;fancy&#34; forbidden things she could see but not touch.</p><p>Shirley Hershey Showalter grew up on a family farm and went on to become the president of Goshen College and a foundation executive at The Fetzer Institute. She is now a writer, blogger, and consultant living in Harrisonburg, VA. She is the mother of two adult children and grandmother of two little ones. She and her husband Stuart spent the 2011-2012 academic year taking care of grandson Owen while living in Brooklyn, NY. Most of her memoir was written in Brooklyn.Showalter, now a former college president, was born to a Mennonite family in Lititz, Penn., and much of her memoir takes place in this small town with a Mennonite community at its center. Aside from initial chapters that outline basic information about Showalter&#39;s ancestors, this is mainly the story of Showalter&#39;s childhood, up to her teenage years. The author-memoirist describes growing up Mennonite; her story affords glimpses into this religion&#39;s traditions and rituals. Readers learn how a Mennonite community responds to families in mourning, as when Showalter&#39;s sister dies, and how women in Mennonite families pass on culinary heirlooms, i.e., handwritten recipe books. Unfortunately, Showalter&#39;s simplistic writing style limits the scope of some of her observations. The fact that the memoir is written in chronological order makes it read like a diary and deprives it of narrative drive. Filled with platitudes (Everyone&#39;s childhood is some mixture of sweet and sour), this memoir will interest readers who want to learn about growing up Mennonite, but it provides more information than insight.

In fact, Reinhart has been fermenting this particular loaf of wisdom for years. On a worldwide level he is known as a master baker and author of the award-winning cookbook <i>Crust and Crumb</i>. On another (but equally important) level he is a spiritual pilgrim who finally planted his roots in the Christ the Saviour Brotherhood, an eastern orthodox service order.<p> In this well-written memoir Reinhart demonstrates how a journey to God follows the same rules as the baking of bread. For example, you must have all the right tools to begin. In one case the tools may include meditation and affirmative prayer, in the other they may include baking parchment and spatulas. (Although Reinhart is now in a Christian orthodox order, his voice and quest could easily appeal to any spiritual orientation.) As in <i>Like Water for Chocolate</i>, Reinhart inserts bread recipes into each chapter of his book as he shares his hard-earned spiritual maturity and personal story. As a result, his stories, wisdom, and bread recipes are more easily understood, savored, and digested. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Peter Reinhart is a lay brother in the Christ the Saviour Brotherhood, an eastern orthodox service community.

In 1961, she was one of two black students to desegregate the University of Georgia.&nbsp;<br><b>From the Introduction</b><br> &nbsp;<br>This is a new kind of book about the world vision of Martin Luther King, Jr. Too many people continue to think of Dr. King as "a southern civil rights leader" or "an American Gandhi," thus ignoring his impact on poor and oppressed people everywhere. <i>&#x201c;In a Single Garment of Destiny&#x201d;</i> is the first book to treat King&#x2019;s positions on global liberation struggles through the prism of his own words and activities. &nbsp;The purpose is not only celebration, but also a critical engagement with a towering figure whose ideas and social praxis have become so significant in the reshaping of the modern world. &nbsp;<br><br>King&#x2019;s interest in the problems of the poor and oppressed worldwide was evident long before he achieved national and international prominence. &nbsp;He came out of a family background that encouraged a concern for world affairs; his own father, Martin Luther King, Sr., the distinguished pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, communicated with black South African activists and addressed the problems of racism and poverty in America and in other lands when King, Jr. was a child. Inspired by this family tradition, King, Jr., at age fifteen, in a high school speech called, &#x201c;The Negro and the Constitution,&#x201d; spoke of the resonating irony of an America claiming freedom while denying basic rights to blacks, and also referred to the United States&#x2019; moral responsibility in a world that threatened the true flowering of democracy. As a student at Atlanta&#x2019;s Morehouse College and at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania in the late forties and early fifties, King, Jr. came to the conclusion that blacks in America would not win genuine freedom as long as peoples of color abroad suffered on grounds of race and economics.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>King had experiences in Montgomery, Alabama that not only increased his interest in international events, but also solidified his commitment to ending racism, poverty, colonialism, and other social evils that disproportionately afflicted black Americans and peoples in the so-called Third World. &nbsp;While serving as pastor of Montgomery&#x2019;s Dexter Avenue Baptist Church from 1954 to 1959, King occasionally drew parallels between white racism in the United States and European colonialism in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and it was his conviction that the black struggle in the Jim Crow South had much to contribute to and learn from movements for independence abroad. This conviction matured during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955-56, and was significantly reinforced when King attended the independence celebrations in Ghana at the request of Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah in March, 1957, and also when he visited India, &#x201c;the land of Gandhi,&#x201d; in 1959.&nbsp; Inspired by his experiences and travels abroad, King actually joined the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) in the late 1950s, a New York-based organization of Christian pacifists who contributed to freedom movements inside South Africa, and who advocated nonviolent approaches in the assault on systems of oppression everywhere.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The 1960s brought similar involvements on King&#x2019;s part.&nbsp; Although his work through his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the ACOA, and the American Negro Leadership Conference on Africa (ANLCA) are more widely known, he also endorsed and supported numerous organizations throughout the world that contributed financially, morally, and in other ways to freedom movements. &nbsp;&nbsp;King actually combined such activities with a powerful and consistent advocacy for world peace in pulpits throughout America and in other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;As far back as the late 1950s, he had called for the total eradication of war, and, by the early 1960s, had signed numerous statements with other liberal Americans condemning nuclear testing. &nbsp;&nbsp;By the time of his death in April, 1968, King had become completely convinced that the achievement of world peace and community hinged on the elimination of what he called &#x201c;the world&#x2019;s three greatest social evils&#x201d;; namely, racism, poverty, and war. (See Part I, "All of God's Children: Toward a Global Vision.")<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>More specifics on how King sought to connect the civil rights movement with freedom struggles abroad would be helpful here in grasping the depth of his belief in &nbsp;global liberation, or what he called "a new world order." In July, 1957, King joined Eleanor Roosevelt and Bishop James A. Pike as initial sponsors, under the auspices of the ACOA, of the worldwide <i>Declaration of Conscience</i>, a document included in this volume. The declaration proclaimed December 10, 1957, Human Rights Day, as a day to protest against the organized inhumanity of the South African Government and its racial apartheid policies, and it urged churches, universities, trade unions, business and professional organizations, veteran groups, and members of all other free associations to devote the day to prayer, demonstrations, acts of civil disobedience, and other forms of nonviolent protest. The <i>Declaration of Conscience</i>, signed by 123 heads of state and religious leaders and scholars, actually symbolized, perhaps more than anything else, King&#x2019;s efforts to establish links between the struggle in the American South and the black South African anti-apartheid cause.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>In July, 1962, King and the black South African leader Albert J. Luthuli became co-sponsors, under the banner of the ACOA, of the worldwide <i>Appeal for Action Against Apartheid</i>, a declaration also included in this book. &nbsp;&nbsp;This crusade was in the nature of a follow-up to the global effort of 1957. &nbsp;King and Luthuli, both ministers and activists committed to nonviolence, had communicated with each other through the mail since the late 1950s, and, although they never met, they shared a commitment to the poor and the oppressed everywhere, or what King called &#x201c;the least of these.&#x201d; &nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>Appeal for Action Against Apartheid </i>called upon churches, unions, lodges, clubs, and other groups and associations to make December 10, 1962, Human Rights day, a day for meetings, protest, and prayer, and to urge their governments to push for the international isolation of South Africa through diplomatic and economic sanctions against that country. &nbsp;Aside from King and Luthuli, 150 social activists and religious and world leaders signed the appeal. &nbsp;At that same time, King and his SCLC were launching a major campaign to strike down the entire system of segregation in Albany, Georgia.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>King&#x2019;s strategy was to build a coalition of conscience in America while contributing to a larger, worldwide coalition of conscience to challenge racism internationally. &nbsp;He made major speeches on South African apartheid in England in December, 1964, while en route to Oslo, Norway to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, and at Hunter College in New York in December, 1965. &nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1964 speech, King highlighted the need for the release of imprisoned black South African leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Robert Sobukwe, and challenged the world community, especially the United States and England, to withdraw all economic support for the South African regime, including the purchase of gold. &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, King's statements on the white supremacist policies and practices of the South African government at that time received little or no attention from major media sources in America and Europe.<br>&nbsp; <br>In the 1965 speech, delivered after King and his coalition of conscience had spearheaded a successful voting rights campaign in Selma, Alabama, King reiterated the call for economic sanctions against South Africa, and he declared that &#x201c;the potent nonviolent path&#x201d; that had brought racial change in the U.S. and liberation to India and regions in Africa should be employed on a more global scale to defeat the forces of racism in South Africa and globally. &nbsp;The failure to respond creatively and constructively to racism as a world problem, said King in one of his last books, <i>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? </i>(1967), could only lead to a race war and perhaps the fall of Western civilization. &nbsp;Interestingly enough, King's call for economic sanctions would be echoed repeatedly in the 1980s, twenty years later, as the world grew less and less tolerant of the South African apartheid system. <br><br>In recent years, the United Nations has held a number of international conferences on racism, and this should also be a reminder of the timelessness of certain concerns that King raised around that issue. &nbsp;King recognized in his own time that the dialogue on race necessarily had to be reframed, far beyond but not neglecting black-white relations in the United States, and this need continues today. Predictions of the emergence of a post-racial America (and world) after the election of President Barack Obama have proven premature, and some scholars are now writing about the globalization of racism. King wrote of this phenomenon years ago, and his prescience and the continuing relevance of his insights need to be appreciated and better understood. (The documents included in Parts II and III, including "The Color Bar" and "Breaking the Bonds of Colonialism" have much to offer, regarding racist ideology and practices.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>King felt that the assault on world racism could not be successfully made without an equally powerful attack on poverty and economic injustice as international problems. &nbsp;From the time of the Montgomery bus boycott, which clearly had economic repercussions, King spoke of racism and economic injustice as perennial allies, but his most persistent, organized attack on the problems emerged in the mid and late 1960s. &nbsp;King led a nonviolent army against economic inequality and discrimination in real estate in Chicago in 1965-66, and Eugene Carson Blake and others in the National and World Council of Churches felt that the Chicago Freedom Movement might provide a model for attacking poverty on the international level. &nbsp;King and his SCLC continued the assault by organizing a Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign in 1967, and by participating in a strike of sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee in early 1968. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>But King realized that blacks in America were not the only victims of poverty in the world. &nbsp;This mindset helps us understand his plan to intersect blacks, poor whites, Mexicans, Native Americans, and other racial and ethnic groups in the Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign, a campaign he would not live to lead. &nbsp;&nbsp;This also accounted for his financial and moral support for liberation movements worldwide, and his devotion to an analysis of world poverty in his last two books: <i>Where Do We Go from Here: Chaos or Community? </i>(1967) and <i>The Trumpet of Conscience</i> (1968). &nbsp;King's insights into and analysis of &nbsp;world poverty, and also his recommendations for attacking and eliminating the problem, still rank among the most penetrating and sophisticated on record.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>King pointed out that two thirds of the world lived in grinding poverty, a problem that inevitably led to undernourishment, malnutrition, homelessness, the lack of health care, disease, and death. &nbsp;As King saw it, the population explosion merely exacerbated the problem. King called for "a radical redistribution" of the world&#x2019;s economic and material resources, to feed the unfed, to clothe the naked, to house the homeless, and to heal the sick. &nbsp;This all-out war against world poverty would also include, in his estimation, a sort of foreign aid program by which America, Canada, and wealthy nations in Western Europe would provide capital and technical assistance for underdeveloped countries. &nbsp;Mindful of how the Western powers had long exploited poor nations through systems of colonialism and neo-colonialism, King insisted that foreign aid be provided out of a sense of moral obligation, and not as just another gimmick for controlling poor and underdeveloped countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Almost a half century after King&#x2019;s death, poverty and economic injustice are still the close companions of racism, and the gap that separate what King called the <i>haves </i>from the<i> have-nots </i>of the world has grown wider. &nbsp;The United Nations&#x2019; world food programs and foreign aid from wealthy nations have done little to end the problem. &nbsp;&#x201c;The least of these&#x201d; can still be found in every nation, including the United States and Western Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;Coalitions of conscience that fight against poverty and economic exploitation, based on the model provided by King and SCLC in the Poor People&#x2019;s Campaign, are virtually non-existent. &nbsp;Furthermore, the bankruptcy of the global economy is increasingly in the realm of the possibility. In such a world climate, there is still much to be learned from King about how individuals, social groups, and nations might work together to insure that people everywhere have adequate material resources and the basic necessities of life. (See documents in Part IV, Chapter 7.)<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>The same might be said of war and human destruction. As far back as the 1950s, King opposed war on moral and pragmatic grounds,&nbsp; and, by the early 1960s, had signed numerous statements with other liberal Americans condemning it as "the most colossal" of all social evils.&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, and to some extent before that time, King dismissed war as obsolete, maintaining that all violence was ultimately irrational, immoral, and self-defeating. &nbsp;He used the Vietnam conflict to drive home his point about the evils of war, pointing especially to the unnecessary slaughter of the Vietnamese people and the destruction of their homes, places of worship, and rice fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;From 1965 until his assassination in 1968, King consistently denounced what he termed America&#x2019;s misadventure in Vietnam in the pulpits of churches and during peace demonstrations in the streets of America. &nbsp;King felt that it was his moral duty as a prophet and as "a citizen of the world" to do so. His most celebrated speech on the subject, &#x201c;A Time to Break Silence,&#x201d; was delivered at the historic Riverside Church in New York City on April 4, 1967, exactly a year before his murder.&nbsp; In the late 1960s, King also turned once again to a coalition of conscience, Clergy and Laity Concerned About Vietnam (CALC), to more effectively address Vietnam and the problem of war generally. &nbsp;Some of King&#x2019;s most powerful addresses on war were printed and circulated through CALC in the late sixties, among which were &#x201c;The Casualties of the War in Vietnam&#x201d; and &#x201c;Beyond Vietnam.&#x201d; &nbsp;(These and ot...</p><h2>Don't: A manual of mistakes &amp; improprieties more or less prevalent in conduct and speech</h2><p>The manual of mistakes and improprieties</p><p></p><h2>LifeLaunch: A Passionate Guide to the Rest of Your Life (5th Edition)</h2><p>A LifeLaunch is the beginning of a new chapter of your life.

It covers many Jewish authors and their writings from the middle of the 16th until the late 18th centuries in Europe. The book&#39;s combined approach to the history of science and Jewish thought strongly emphasises analysis of the mentalities that informed some of the prominent figures of Jewish thought in this time period. Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe takes a comprehensive look at the processes taking place in the minds of European Jewish intellectuals in Italy, Amsterdam, Prague, and London. The main purpose of this book is the description of the modalities of reception of the new sciences, complicated by the traditional reticence toward &#34;alien sciences&#34; found in many medieval Jewish writers still influential in the early modern period.</p><p>Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery in Early Modern Europe is a major contribution in understanding the cultural processes involved in the emergence and development of the consumer phase of science.David B.

As she continued on her way toward the art store on University Avenue, the image of Ryan kept playing on a continuous loop in her mind.<br><br>None of the other girls in her tenth-grade class could take their eyes off him, either. At least that was one thing that didn't make her stick out from the rest of her class. Her clay-stained fingers and clothes along with the "new girl" sign she felt like she was wearing during her first few weeks at every new school did that with no help whatsoever from Ryan...or his ridiculously good looks.<br><br>Normally, she would have gotten over his pretty face without much trouble. As an artist, she always worked to look beneath the surface of things, to try to find out what was really at the heart of a painting or sculpture or song. That went for people, too. Especially boys who, as far as she could tell, only ever told a girl what they wanted to hear for one reason.<br><br>No, what had her stuck on Ryan Sullivan was the fact that he was always laughing. Somehow, without being the class clown, he had a gift for putting people at ease and making them feel good.<br><br>Before she could catch herself, she put her fingers to her lips...and wondered what it would feel like if he kissed her.<br><br>She yanked her hand away from her mouth. Not just because dreaming of his kisses was borderline pathetic given the utter unlikelihood of that scenario, but because she needed to stay focused on her art.<br><br>She wasn't just another tenth grader mooning over the hottest boy in school.<br><br>She was studying her muse.<br><br>Vicki had never been much interested in sculpting formal busts before. Old, dead, overly serious guys in gray didn't really do it for her. But it had only taken a few minutes near Ryan at lunch her first day on campus to be inspired to capture his laughter in clay. She wished she could get closer to all that easy joy&#x2014;if only to figure out how to translate it from her mind's eye to the clay beneath her fingers.<br><br>Yes, she thought with a small smile, she was perfectly willing to suffer for her art. Especially if it meant staring at Ryan Sullivan.<br><br>She was almost across the school parking lot when she noticed the traffic light turned from red to green. She could pick up her pace and make it across the street, but she slowed down instead. She'd been having such trouble getting the corners of the eyes and mouth just right on her <em>Laughing Boy</em> sculpture. Knowing there wasn't a chance that Ryan or his friends would notice her, rather than leaving the school grounds she closed the distance between them in as nonchalant a manner as she could. Surreptitiously, she observed Ryan from beneath the veil of the bangs that had grown too long over her eyes during the summer.<br><br>A few seconds later, his friends high-fived him and walked away. Ryan bent down to finish packing up a long, narrow black bag at his feet, which she guessed held his baseball stuff.<br><br>What, she wondered on an appreciative sigh at the way the muscles on his forearms and shoulders flexed as he picked up the bag, would happen if she talked to him? And what would he say if she asked him outright to pose for her?<br><br>She was on the verge of laughing out loud at her crazy thoughts when she heard a squeal of tires seemingly coming from out of nowhere in the parking lot. In a split second she realized an out-of-control car was fishtailing straight toward Ryan.<br><br>There wasn't time to plan, or to think. Without a moment's hesitation, Vicki sprinted across the several feet between them and threw herself at him.<br><br><em>"Car!"</em><br><br>Fortunately, Ryan's natural athleticism kicked in right away. Even though she was the one trying to pull him out of the way, less than a heartbeat later he was lifting her and practically throwing her across the grass before leaping to cover her body with his.<br><br>She scrunched her eyes tightly shut as the car careened past, so close that she could feel the hairs on her arms lifting in its wake. Breathing hard, Vicki clung to Ryan. Wetness moved across her cheeks and she realized tears must have sprung up from landing so hard on the grass.<br><br>The seconds ticked by as if in slow motion, one hard, thudding heartbeat after another from Ryan's chest to hers and then back again from hers to his. He was so strong, so warm, so beautifully real. She wanted to lie like this with him forever, more intimately, closer than she'd ever been with another boy.<br><br>Only, as voices rose in pitch all around them, suddenly the reality of what had just happened hit her.<br><br><em>Oh, my God, they'd both almost died!</em> She was starting to feel faint when he lifted his head and smiled down at her. "Hi, I'm Ryan."<br><br>The way he said it, as if she didn't already know who he was, pierced through her shock. He acted as if it was normal to be sprawled all over a girl. Which, she suddenly realized, it probably was. For him.<br><br>Definitely <em>not</em> for her, though.<br><br>Her lips were dry and she had to lick them once, twice, before saying, "I'm Victoria." The words, "But my friends call me Vicki," slipped out before she could pull them back in.<br><br>His smile widened and her heart started beating even faster. Not from shock this time, but from pure, unfettered teenage hormones kicked into overdrive by his beautiful smile.<br><br>"Thank you for saving my life, Vicki." A moment later, his smile disappeared as he took in her tear-streaked cheeks. The eyes that she'd seen filled with laughter so many times during the first two weeks of school grew serious. "I hurt you."<br><br>She would have told him no, and that she was fine, but all breath and words were stolen from her the instant he brushed his fingertips over her cheeks to wipe away her tears.<br><br>Somehow, she managed to shake her head, and to get her lips to form the word <em>no,</em> even though no sound followed.<br><br>His laughing eyes were dark now, and more intense than she'd ever seen them. "Are you sure? I didn't mean to land so hard on you."<br><br>"I'm&#x2014;"<br><br>How was she supposed to keep her brain working when he'd begun the slow, shockingly sweet process of running his hands over the back of her skull, and then down to her shoulders and upper arms?<br><br>One more word. That was all she needed to be able to answer his question.<br><br>"&#x2014;fine."<br><br>"Good." His voice was deeper, richer than any of the other fifteen-year-old boys she knew. "I'm glad."<br><br>But as he stared down at her, his expression continued to grow even more intense and she found herself holding her breath.<br><br>Was he going to kiss her now? Had her life just turned into the quintessential after-school-special fantasy, the one where the artsy girl caught the eye of the jock and the whole school was turned upside down by their unlikely but ultimately perfect and inevitable pairing?<br><br>"One day, when you need me most, I promise I'll be there for you, Vicki."<br><br><em>Oh.</em> She swallowed hard. <em>Oh, my.</em><br><br>He hadn't given her a kiss...but his promise felt more important than a mere kiss would have been.<br><br>Before she realized it, he was standing up again and holding out a hand to help her up, too. Instantly she missed feeling his heat and his hard muscles pressing into her softer ones. All the lies she'd been trying to tell herself about Ryan simply being a muse scattered out of reach.<br><br>"Can I walk you home?"<br><br>Surprised that he wanted to spend more time with her, she quickly shook her head.<br><br>He looked equally surprised by her response, likely because no girl on earth had ever turned him down.<br><br>"No, I can't walk you home?" he asked again.<br><br>She fumbled to explain. "I'm not going home. I was actually heading over to the art store to pick up some supplies for a new sculpt&#x2014;"<br><br>She barely stopped herself from rambling on about her latest project. Why would Ryan Sullivan care? Besides, she reminded her racing heart with brutal honesty, he probably had some pretty cheerleaders waiting on him. And they wouldn't need an out-of-control car to get him to lie down on top of them.<br><br>No matter how tempting it was to believe that she had suddenly been cast in a happy-ever-after fairytale romance, the truth was that getting that close to Ryan had been nothing more than a fluke of fate.<br><br>And Vicki remained the star of her artsy, and often lonely, move-to-a-new-town-every-year-with-her-military-family teenage life.<br><br>Only, for some strange reason she couldn't understand, Ryan wasn't running in the opposite direction yet. <em>Probably because he felt like he owed her after she 'd saved his life.</em> After all, hadn't he just told her that he would be there for her one day when she really needed him?<br><br>"What are you getting supplies for?" He asked the question as though he were truly interested, not just acting like it because he felt he should.<br><br>"I'm making a&#x2014;" Wait, she couldn't tell him what she was making. Because she was sculpting <em>him.</em> "I work with clay. Lately, I've been trying to capture specific facial expressions."<br><br>"Which ones?"<br><br>Never in a million years did she think she'd ever speak to him, let alone have this long a conversation. But what shocked her most of all was just how comfortable she felt with him. Even with all of her teenage hormones on high alert, Ryan was, simply, the easiest person she'd ever been around.<br><br>And she wanted more time with him than just five stolen minutes on the high school lawn.<br><br>Her nerves were starting to back off a bit by the time she told him, "I started with all the usual expressions every artist knows best." She played it up for him. "Tears. Pain. Suffering. Existential nothingness."<br><br>His laughter made her feel like she could float all the way to the art store and back.<br><br>"Sounds fun."<br><br>"Oh, yeah," she joked back, "it's a riot. Which is why I'm trying something different now." She took a breath before admitting, "I'm working on laughter."<br><br>"Laughter, huh?" He grinned at her. "I like it. How's it going?"<br><br>Being so close to the full wattage of his smile made her breath catch in her throat. In an effort to cover her all-too-obvious reaction to him, she scrunched up her face. "Let me put it this way, I think I've started to resemble all those other expressions."<br><br>"Even the existential nothingness one?"<br><br>As if she were watching the two of them from a distance, Vicki knew she'd always look back to that moment as the one that mattered most. The one where she fell head over heels in love with Ryan Sullivan. And not because of his beautiful outside.<br><br>But because he'd listened.<br><br>And, even better, because he'd appreciated.<br><br>"Especially that one," she replied.<br><br>He picked up her bag from the grass. "Sounds awesome. Mind if I tag along?"<br><br>Okay, so maybe the two of them didn't add up on paper, but Vicki couldn't deny that they had clicked.<br><br>"Sure," she said, "if you don't have anywhere else you have to be."<br><br>He slung his equipment bag over his other shoulder and walked beside her. "Nothing more important than hanging out with a new friend."<br><br>This time, she was the one grinning at him. In the two weeks since she'd moved to Palo Alto with her family, she hadn't done a very good job of making friends at the high school. As an army brat who moved every year more often than not, she'd stopped making the effort. A long time ago, when she'd realized how hard it was to break into fully formed cliques or maintain long-distance friendships, she just stopped trying, knowing she would inevitably have to move again.<br><br>But Ryan made everything seem so easy, as if the only thing that wouldn't make sense would be if they didn't hang out.<br><br>By the end of their trip to the art store she knew all about his seven siblings, he knew she had two annoying little brothers, he'd told her what he liked about baseball, she'd told him what she loved about sculpting and before she knew it she'd been invited to dinner at the Sullivan house.<br><br>It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.<br><br>The best one she'd ever had.<br><br></p><h2>Snail</h2><p>It&#39;s been nearly 20 years since Miller&#39;s raunchy cartoon-satire Amerloque--and he is still writing in that now-dated Zap Comix style: this novel of metamorphosis goes off with undeniable verve and determination, mixing Vonnegut with Ovid, sci-fi with hippy-dippy paranoia. The premise: Nazi Field Marshal Baron Werner von Blomberg, a Hitler confidant at the end, is saved from self-destruction by the intervention of the Wandering Jew (a.k.a. George Baxter); Blomberg is turned into a 16-year-old again rather than an inglorious corpse--and it&#39;s only the first of several incarnations for the Field Marshal. Calling himself Allen Edricson, he meets up with the goddess Athena and goes from Paris to New Orleans--where he works for a time at a bestiality magazine. Then it&#39;s on to San Francisco, with Blomberg always searching for the key, the three &#34;&#34;pieces of power&#34;&#34; that together unlock all energy. In the meantime, though, he&#39;s continuously subject to Athena&#39;s whims: he&#39;s forever being changed into a woman, back to a man, then into a snail. (There are literary avatars, too: in homage, Miller works in Vonnegut&#39;s character Kilgore Trout--released as he was by authorial dispensation from Breakfast of Champions.)</p><p></p><h2>Sundials: History, Theory, and Practice</h2><p><p>"His lively pen, his direct and simple style, his expressive vocabulary, his avoidance of pedantry, his conciseness in the exposition of his thoughts make his book a pleasure to read." &#x2014; Henri Michel, International Academy of the History of Science<br>The story of man's efforts to measure time is a long one &#x2014; reaching back thousands of years to the dawn of civilization.

Kirkus declared it "a wonderful frolic in mud and verse." Lynn has worked for twenty years as a public school speech-language therapist. She is also the author of ten educational books, including the Classroom Listening and Speaking series. Lynn lives with her husband and three children in Winthrop, Maine, where she has been seen jumping in piles of leaves during her favorite season of fall.The bouncing, methodical rhyme scheme that served Plourde well in her humorous Pig in the Mud in the Middle of the Rud and her recent Moose, of Course! works against the theme in this bedtime book. As Mother Earth repeatedly tries to put her daughter to sleep, she's met with the same reply, " 'Not for a while,' said her wild child," who comes up with a variety of stalling tactics, including a song, a snack and, of course, a kiss goodnight. Each spread offers a number of clues as to the wild child's identity, most of which are smoothly integrated into Couch's (Moonball) artwork. While he keeps the girl visibly human in face and stature, fall leaves make up her hair; and hills, streams and stones comprise Mother Earth's beautifully sensuous lines and curves as she gives her daughter the gifts of the season (e.g., a snack of "Crunchy, munchy,/ chewy chestnuts./ Plumpy, lumpy,/ pulpy pumpkins"). His subtle brushwork and golden palette convey a dusk slowly metamorphosing to nightfall. Unfortunately, the jarring closing lines, which describe the mother's kiss, end the book on an eerie note: "A gusty, blustery, twisty embrace./ A crystalish, icicle-ish,/ icebergy kiss." Couch's artwork, showing Mother Earth tucking the girl (revealed to be Autumn) into bed, softens the imagery, but readers may well be put off by the cool language for a ritual usually characterized by warmth.

A deadly plague developed during the brutal &#39;Great Germ War&#39; has reached the futuristic metropolis of Mega-City Two, located on the West Coast of the USA. Charged with delivering a life-saving vaccine to the citizens of the disease-ridden city, Judge Dredd and a small crew of Judges, war droids and the lawbreaking biker, Spikes Harvey Rotten, must travel a thousand miles across the radioactive wasteland known as &#39;the Cursed Earth.&#39; It is a near-impossible journey hate-filled mutants, rampaging monsters and crazed war robots populate the hellish stretch of terrain. Many men have attempted to cross it and most have failed. But Judge Dredd is the best there is!</p><p>Pat Mills is the creator and first editor of 2000 AD. For the Galaxy&#39;s Greatest Comic, he is the writer and co-creator of ABC Warriors, Finn, Flesh, Nemesis the Warlock, Slaine, M.A.C.H 1, Harlem Heroes and Savage. Outside 2000 AD he is the writer and co-creator of the long-running classic anti-war story Charley&#39;s War, as well as Marshal Law. He has also written for the Batman, Star Wars and Zombie World series for the US market. Currently Mills is writing the best-selling series Requiem -- Vampire Knight for Editions Nickel of France with artist Olivier Ledroit, and a spin-off series, Claudia -- Vampire Knight, with artist Frank Tacito. Two further French series are in production.br John Wagner is, to many fans, the very heart of 2000 AD. Involved from the earliest days of the Galaxy&#39;s Greatest Comic, he co-created Judge Dredd, as well as a whole cast of other memorable characters. His Paradox Press graphic novel A History of Violence was made into a major film by director David Cronenberg, and Judge Dredd adapted into a film twice, most recently in DREDD by Alex Garland and Pete Travis. Perhaps the most popular 2000 AD artist of all time, Brian Bolland&#39;s clean-line style and meticulous attention to detail ensure that his artwork on strips including Dan Dare, Future Shocks, Judge Dredd and Walter the Wobot looks as fresh today as it did when first published. Co-creator of both Judge Anderson and The Kleggs, Bolland&#39;s highly detailed style unfortunately precluded him from doing many sequential strips -- although he found the time to pencil both Camelot 3000 and Batman: The Killing Joke for DC Comics.br Although Mike McMahon may not have illustrated as many strips as other 2000 AD creators, his importance to the comic cannot be overstated. It was McMahon who co-created perennial classics A.B.C. Warriors and The V.C.&#39;s, and it was also McMahon who gave Judge Dredd his classic, defining, &#34;big boots&#34; look. McMahon has also illustrated One-Offs, Ro- Busters, and provided a classic run on Slaine. Outside of the Galaxy&#39;s Greatest Comic, he has pencilled Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight and The Last American, which he co-created with John Wagner.</p><h2>In the Land of Fairies</h2><p>In this delightful picture book for children, atmospheric illustrations reveal the secret life of fairies and nature spirits.

As she walks through London, buying flowers, observing life, her thoughts are in the past, and she remembers the time when she was as young as her own daughter Elizabeth; her romance with Peter Walsh, now recently returned from India; and the friends of her youth. Elsewhere in London, Septimus Smith is being driven mad by shell shock. As the day draws to its end, his world and Clarissa&#39;s collide in unexpected ways.</p><p>As Clarissa Dalloway walks through London on a fine June morning, a sky-writing plane captures her attention. Crowds stare upwards to decipher the message while the plane turns and loops, leaving off one letter, picking up another. Like the airplane's swooping path, Virginia Woolf's <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> follows Clarissa and those whose lives brush hers--from Peter Walsh, whom she spurned years ago, to her daughter Elizabeth, the girl's angry teacher, Doris Kilman, and war-shocked Septimus Warren Smith, who is sinking into madness.<p> As Mrs. Dalloway prepares for the party she is giving that evening, a series of events intrudes on her composure. Her husband is invited, without her, to lunch with Lady Bruton (who, Clarissa notes anxiously, gives the most amusing luncheons). Meanwhile, Peter Walsh appears, recently from India, to criticize and confide in her. His sudden arrival evokes memories of a distant past, the choices she made then, and her wistful friendship with Sally Seton.</p><p> Woolf then explores the relationships between women and men, and between women, as Clarissa muses, "It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together.... Her relation in the old days with Sally Seton. Had not that, after all, been love?" While Clarissa is transported to past afternoons with Sally, and as she sits mending her green dress, Warren Smith catapults desperately into his delusions. Although his troubles form a tangent to Clarissa's web, they undeniably touch it, and the strands connecting all these characters draw tighter as evening deepens. As she immerses us in each inner life, Virginia Woolf offers exquisite, painful images of the past bleeding into the present, of desire overwhelmed by society's demands. <i>--Joannie Kervran Stangeland</i></p>This edition of Mrs. Dalloway includes substantial explanatory notes compiling past scholarship while identifying new allusions, and a list of textual variants among all editions in Woolf&#39;s lifetime. It also features a composition history, documenting how Woolf&#39;s reading, friendships, and culture contributed to the book, and Woolf&#39;s seldom-reprinted 1928 introduction.</p><h2>Olympic, Titanic, Britannic: An Illustrated History of the Olympic Class Ships</h2><p><b>A pictorial celebration of the world-famous sister ships: the Olympic-class liners</b> &nbsp; A&nbsp;maritime expert tells the story of the sister ships&nbsp;using previously unseen pictures, passenger diaries, and deck plans, illustrating <i>Olympic's</i> successful career; the premature ends of her two unfortunate sisters; and the experiences of those onboard.

Ironically, fate decreed that only <i>Olympic</i> would ever complete a single commercial voyage and she went on to serve for a quarter of a century in peace and war. <i>Titanic's</i> name would become infamous after she sank on her maiden voyage.

Deconstruction, which has reduced literary works to "texts" and denuded them of determinate meaning, is seen as an extreme extension of the relativism that pervades 20th-century Western society. Kernan is lively but opinionated, especially relishing barbs against left-leaning critics, Marxists, feminists, and such "red-lib causes" as openness, toleration, and individualism. This is a very wide-ranging expose--covering politics, law, aesthetics, technology, commerce, and even lexicography--that raises profound questions but sadly fails to coalesce. It basically ends with a shrug, an amorphous hope that literature can find a useful role in human life.<br><i>- Jeffrey R.

Mavis Hetherington</b> is professor emeritus, Department of Psychology, University of Virginia. <b>John Kelly</b> is a writer in New York.University of Virginia psychology professor Hetherington and writer Kelly offer a "primer" on the "postnuclear family experience." After studying more than 1,400 families and 2,500 children over three decades, Hetherington sees divorce as part of a series of "interconnected transitions" in life rather than a one-time event. While destructive in the short-term, divorce can also be positive, creating new opportunities for long-term personal growth. The authors begin by looking at the character of the marital relationship, which is like a bank account: each partner makes "deposits" of strengthening factors (like mutual support and intimacy) and "withdrawals" that debilitate the relationship. The emotional base of the marriage erodes if there's an imbalance of "deposits" and "withdrawals" for too long, resulting in divorce. Depending on their "protective" factors (maturity, autonomy) vs. "risk" (impulsiveness, antisociability), ex-partners will weather the stormy first year after divorce with varying degrees of resilience. After six years, most are happier. While the general picture is fairly positive, the detail can be unnerving. Children may be adjusting, but after six years, a quarter of them see their noncustodial father once a year or less. One fourth of ex-spouses are still having conflicts after six years. Most stepfathers give up the struggle to connect with resisting stepchildren after two years. With these darker realities in mind, the authors offer a series of practical suggestions at the end of each chapter. (Jan. 21)Forecast: Given the vast number of people divorcing all the time, the market for this jargon-free book should be huge. But its scholarly bent (aimed at its primary audience of upper-level college students and counseling professionals) and its claim to be "the most comprehensive study of divorce in America" may turn off some.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Magical Chorus: A History of Russian Culture from Tolstoy to Solzhenitsyn</h2><p>From the reign of Tsar Nicholas II to the brutal cult of Stalin to the ebullient, uncertain days of perestroika, nowhere has the inextricable relationship between politics and culture been more starkly illustrated than in twentieth-century Russia. In the first book to fully examine the intricate and often deadly interconnection between Russian rulers and Russian artists, cultural historian Solomon Volkov (who experienced firsthand many of the events he describes) brings to life the human stories behind some of the greatest masterpieces of our time.<br><br>Here is Tolstoy, who used his godlike place among the Russian people to rail against the autocracy, even as he eschewed violence; Gorky, the first native writer to openly welcome the revolution and who would go on to become Stalin&#x2019;s closest cultural advisor; Solzhenitsyn, who famously brought the horrors of the Soviet regime to light. Here. too, are Nabokov, Pasternak, Mayakovsky, Akhmatova. In each case, Volkov analyzes the alternate determination and despair, hope and terror borne by writers in a country where, in Solzhenitsyn&#x2019;s maxim, &#x201c;a great writer is like a second government.&#x201d;<br><br>This is also the story of the nation&#x2019;s leading lights in painting, music, dance, theater, and cinema&#x2014;Kandinsky and Malevich, Rachmaninoff and Stravinsky, Diaghilev and Nijinsky, Stanislavsky and Meyerhold, and Eisenstein and Tarkovsky&#x2014;and the ways in which their triumphs influenced, and were influenced by, the leadership of the time. <br><br>With an insider&#x2019;s insight, Volkov describes what it was like to work under constant threat of arrest, exile, or execution. He reminds us of the many artists who were compelled to live as �migr�s, and explores not only their complicated relationships with their adopted countries but Russia&#x2019;s love-hate relationship with Western culture as a whole&#x2014;a relationship that has grown increasingly charged in the wake of the Soviet Union&#x2019;s collapse.<br><br>Epic in scope and intimate in detail, <i>The Magical Chorus</i> is the definitive account of a remarkable era in Russia&#x2019;s complex cultural life.</p><p>Solomon Volkov is the award-winning author of several notable books about Russian culture, including <i>St. Petersburg: A Cultural History</i> and <i>Shostakovich and Stalin</i>, published worldwide. After moving to the United States from the Soviet Union, he became a cultural commentator for Voice of America and later for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, broadcasting to the USSR (and later, Russia), where he discussed contemporary artistic developments in his former homeland. He lives in New York City with his wife, Marianna.<br><br>The prizewinning translator Antonina W. Bouis is known for her work with contemporary Russian literature.Part One: THE GATHERING STORM<br>On November 8, 1910, people all over Russia snatched up the latest editions of newspapers reporting the death of Count Leo Tolstoy on the previous day, at 6:05 a.m. at Astapovo Station. The photographs showed perhaps the most famous writer in the world at that time: an austere, gray-bearded man of eighty-two, with high-set, very large ears and shaggy brows drawn over his piercing (some said &#x201c;vulpine&#x201d;) eyes.<br><br>Another world-celebrated writer, though a lesser light, Maxim Gorky, was living in exile on the Italian island of Capri and wrote when he learned of Tolstoy&#x2019;s death: &#x201c;This struck the heart, and I howled with hurt and longing.&#x201d;1 In a letter to a friend, Gorky exclaimed in a typically fanciful manner, &#x201c;A great soul has departed, a soul that had embraced all of Russia, everything that was Russian&#x2014;about whom save Tolstoy can that be said?&#x201d;2 The cosmopolitan modernist poet Valery Briusov stressed the writer&#x2019;s universality in his memorial essay: &#x201c;Tolstoy was for the entire world. His words went to Englishmen, and Frenchmen, and the Japa-nese, and the Buryats.&#x201d;3 From Paris, the political �migr� Bolshevik Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin), doggedly&#x2014;as only he could&#x2014;insisted that Tolstoy&#x2019;s &#x201c;global significance as an artist and his worldwide fame as a thinker and preacher, both reflect in their own way the widespread significance of the Russian revolution.&#x201d;4<br><br>As it happens, all three were probably right. We tend to think of Tolstoy as a cultural phenomenon of the nineteenth century, the author of <i>War and Peace</i> (1863&#x2013;77, perhaps the greatest novel in the history of the genre) and such masterpieces as <i>Anna Karenina</i> (1873&#x2013; 77) and &#x201c;The Death of Ivan Ilyich&#x201d; (1886). Yet this giant dominated both the cultural and the political life of the early twentieth century also. Briusov wasn&#x2019;t exaggerating: Tolstoy combined the fame of Voltaire, the popularity of Rousseau, and the authority of Goethe; he was compared routinely to biblical prophets. In his estate at Yasnaya Polyana, two hundred kilometers south of Moscow, Tolstoy received devotees from all over the world, who flocked to hear his antigovernment and antibourgeois sermons. Gorky, in his memoirs of Tolstoy (a tour de force of twentieth-century Russian nonfiction), confessed that when he looked at him, he thought, not without envy: &#x201c;That man is godlike!&#x201d;<br><br>However, Tolstoy was made up of contradictions, containing &#x201c;multitudes,&#x201d; to use Walt Whitman&#x2019;s phrase. He was simultaneously a born archaist and a natural innovator&#x2014;in his life, in his writing, and in his passionate religious and political beliefs, which sometimes verged on total anarchism. Gorky noted, somewhat caustically (and in seeming contradiction to his worship of Tolstoy): &#x201c;Psychologically it would be quite natural for great artists to be larger than life in their sins, as well.&#x201d;5<br><br>Tolstoy&#x2019;s works, while belonging to the apex of nineteenth-century realism, boldly went beyond its framework: another contradiction. Tolstoy rejected and mocked the modernists, but they made good use of his artistic breakthroughs. It&#x2019;s a surprisingly short distance from Tolstoy&#x2019;s &#x201c;interior monologue&#x201d; to James Joyce&#x2019;s stream of consciousness. Viktor Shklovsky, the bad boy of Russian formalism, early on placed Leo Tolstoy among the avant-garde: &#x201c;Tolstoy in his works, which were constructed as formally as music, used such devices as defamiliarization (calling a thing not by its usual name)&#x201d; and cited his description of the institution of property through the perceptions of a horse.6 This &#x201c;alienation technique&#x201d; (<i>Verfremdungseffekt</i>) was later used and abused by Bertolt Brecht and other European avant-garde writers.<br><br>The publication in 1911&#x2013;1912 of three shabby gray volumes came as a revelation for the Russian public: <i>The Posthumous Fiction of L. N. Tolstoy</i> included the short story &#x201c;Father Sergius&#x201d;; the play <i>The Living Corpse</i>, in which, according to Shklovsky, Tolstoy &#x201c;captured the living speech of trailing sentences&#x201d;; and the prophetic novella about the endless Russo-Chechen war, <i>Khadji Murat</i>, on which he had worked until 1906. A half century later, Shklovsky, no longer holding the radical views of his youth but still habitually spouting paradoxes, maintained that in <i>Khadji Murat</i> Tolstoy had been a forerunner of socialist realism (&#x201c;documentary subject seen through a romantic prism&#x201d;). &#x201c;It is Tolstoy who is the father of socialist realism, not Gorky, as they teach you,&#x201d; Shklovsky told me, still cocky at eighty-two.7<br><br>Since Tolstoy the writer was cast by critics as the patron saint of everything from realism to socialist realism, it comes as no surprise that politically he was variously labeled as well. Contemporaries tried to pin him down as a repentant aristocrat, or the voice of the patriarchal Russian peasantry, or a Christian anarchist, and even as a diehard revolutionary. It was all true to a point: Tolstoy preached an extreme simplicity of life and took a hard libertarian stance toward government, which he considered immoral and illegal, yet he also rejected all forms of violence. In his famous 1909 article &#x201c;I Cannot Be Silent,&#x201d; he protested capital punishment in Russia and did not recognize the authority of organized religion. This inevitably led the rebel count into conflict with the autocracy and the Russian Orthodox Church. Many believed that a confrontation with Tolstoy gravely weakened both institutions.<br>Even in April 1896, just before the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Konstantin Pobedonostsev, the all-powerful High Procurator of the Holy Synod, in charge of the affairs of the Russian Orthodox Church, denounced Tolstoy (in approximately the same indignant language that three-quarters of a century later was heaped on Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn by the Soviet Politburo): &#x201c;He spreads the terrible contagion of anarchy and disbelief throughout Russia. . . . It is obvious that he is the enemy of the Church, the enemy of all government and of all civil order. There is a proposal at the Synod to excommunicate him from the Church, in order to avoid any doubts and misunderstanding in the people, who see and hear that the intelligentsia admires Tolstoy.&#x201d;8<br><br>So, the Holy Synod excommunicated Tolstoy in 1901; a year later he wrote to Nicholas II (calling the tsar &#x201c;beloved brother&#x201d;), putting forth his provocative views on the regime and the church: &#x201c;Autocracy is an obsolete form of rule. . . . And therefore this form of rule and the Orthodoxy connected to it can be supported, as it is today, only through violence: excessive security measures, administrative exiles, executions, religious persecutions, the banning of books and newspapers, warped education, and all sorts of evil and cruel acts.&#x201d;9<br><br>Did Tolstoy actually expect his bold address to so influence the tsar that he would &#x201c;understand the evil he does&#x201d;? Nicholas II simply ignored him, and the writer decided the tsar was &#x201c;a pathetic, weak, and stupid&#x201d; ruler. Tolstoy wanted to teach, not to advise modestly and respectfully, as ritual demanded. Nicholas II (whose advisor then was Pobedonostsev and after 1907, Grigory Rasputin) had no intention of playing pupil. Thus a dialogue did not ensue. Accordingly, Tolstoy&#x2019;s model for the twentieth-century discourse between monarch and great writer, between regime and cultural hero, never took hold. It was this model that later Gorky and Solzhenitsyn&#x2014;each in his own way&#x2014;also tried to establish. Solzheni-tsyn would depict Nicholas II with sympathy and understanding in his novel <i>August 1914</i>: did he perhaps imagine himself as the last tsar&#x2019;s ideal interlocutor and advisor?<br><br>The shrewd Alexei Suvorin, the influential publisher of the pro- monarchist newspaper <i>Novoye Vremya</i> [New Times], wrote in his diary on May 29, 1901: &#x201c;We have two tsars: Nicholas II and Leo Tolstoy. Which is stronger? Nicholas II can&#x2019;t do anything with Tolstoy, he can&#x2019;t shake his throne, while Tolstoy is undoubtedly shaking the throne of Nicholas and his dynasty. Tolstoy is excommunicated by the Synod&#x2019;s decision. Tolstoy replies, the reply is disseminated widely in manuscript form and in the foreign press. Just let anyone try to hurt Tolstoy. The whole world will raise a hue and cry, and our administration will turn tail and run.&#x201d;10<br><br>Suvorin accurately described the situation, which was unprecedented for Russian society. In Tolstoy, Russia&#x2019;s educated classes had a leader who wanted to dictate his solutions to the tsarist government on key social and political issues: war and peace (literally), the distribution of land, and also administrative and judicial reform. &#x201c;The strength of his position,&#x201d; wrote Boris Eikhenbaum, the leading Tolstoy scholar, &#x201c;was that even though he opposed his era, he was still a part of it.&#x201d;11<br><br>It was that tremendous strength that led Lenin to his famous description of Tolstoy in 1908 as &#x201c;the mirror of the Russian revolution.&#x201d; For Lenin, Tolstoy was revolutionary because of his &#x201c;ruthless criticism of capitalist exploitation, his expos� of government coercion and the comedy of the courts and government administration, his baring of the yawning contradictions between the growth of wealth and the growth of poverty.&#x201d;12<br><br>Yet for Tolstoy, earthly power and influence were not enough. Even as a twenty-seven-year-old, Tolstoy came up with a new religion (he noted it in his diary), and he spent his life shaping it, step by step building his image of demigod. In his scheme of things, Christ and Buddha were mere teachers of human wisdom, alongside whom the writer&#x2019;s &#x201c;godlike&#x201d; (in Gorky&#x2019;s phrase) figure could naturally take its place.<br></p><h2>Johnsonville Big Taste of Sausage Cookbook: More Than 125 Recipes for On and Off the Grill from America&#39;s #1 Sausage Maker</h2><p>Johnsonville brats and sausage are the undisputed favorites at sports games, backyard barbecues, and in home kitchens across the country.

You may substitute the apple of your choice, but crisp, slightly tart varieties such as Pink Lady and Golden Delicious best balance the juicy sweetness of Johnsonville Brown Sugar &amp; Honey Links.<br><br>Cinnamon-flavored applesauce works well in place of the apple butter. We like using buttermilk pancake mix in this recipe, but you may wish to use a buckwheat or whole wheat mix. </i><br><br><b>SERVES 8</b><br><br>TOPPING<br>One 12-ounce package Johnsonville Brown Sugar &amp; Honey Links<br>1/4 cup unsalted butter<br>3/4 cup packed brown sugar<br>1/4 cup honey<br>2 1/4 cups peeled and cubed Granny Smith apples<br>1/4 cup apple butter<br><br>PANCAKES<br>2 large eggs<br>1 cup milk<br>2 cups pancake mix<br>1 tablespoon cinnamon<br>3 Granny Smith apples, peeled and grated<br>1/2 cup pecans, toasted<br>1. Preheat the oven to 375�F.<br><br>2. To make the topping: Place the sausage on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes. Turn once, and then bake for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, until the sausage is no longer pink. Drain the sausage, reserving about 1 teaspoon of the fat for brushing. Bias-cut the sausage into 1/2-inch pieces.<br><br>3. In a heavy saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Stir in the brown sugar and honey; bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Add the apples and apple butter. Return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the apples are tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the sausage and heat through, about 1 additional minute. Remove the pan from the heat, and cover to keep warm.<br><br>4. To make the pancakes: In a large bowl, beat together the eggs and milk. Stir in the pancake mix and cinnamon until moistened. If the batter is too thick, you may need to add another drop or two of milk. Fold in the apples.<br><br>5. Heat a griddle. Brush the surface with the reserved fat to prevent sticking. Using a 4-ounce ladle, about 1/2 cup, pour the pancake batter in pools that are 2 inches away from one another. When the pancakes have bubbles on top and are slightly dry around the edges, in about 21/2 minutes, flip them over. Cook until golden on the bottom, about 1 minute.<br><br>6. Serve the pancakes with dollops of the topping. Sprinkle with the pecans, and serve immediately.<br><b>CINNAMON BREAKFAST BAKE</b><br><br>This is one of the simplest, most delicious breakfast recipes you'll ever try. For variation, you may wish to drizzle the finished dish with warm honey before serving. <br><br><b>SERVES 4</b><br><br>One 12-ounce package Johnsonville Brown Sugar &amp; Honey Links<br>12 slices white bread<br>One 21-ounce can apple-pie filling<br>12 large eggs, lightly beaten<br>1 1/2 cups milk<br>1 tablespoon cinnamon<br>1 tablespoon vanilla<br>1. Preheat the oven to 350�F.<br><br>2. Prepare the links according to the package instructions. Allow to cool slightly. Slice into 1/4-inch coins.<br><br>3. Cube the bread and place it into a greased 9-by-13-inch pan.<br><br>4. In a large bowl, combine the pie filling, eggs, milk, cinnamon, vanilla, and sausage coins. Pour this mixture over the bread, making certain that the apples and sausage are distributed evenly.<br><br>5. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until the eggs are set. Let stand 10 minutes before slicing.<br><b>VERMONT MAPLE SYRUP BREAKFAST PIZZA</b><br><br>Pizza for breakfast? You bet. Fluffy scrambled eggs, mouth-watering Vermont Maple Syrup Links, and thick and chunky salsa are placed on a prebaked pizza crust, then covered with mozzarella cheese that bakes up bubbly and golden brown. You may wish to add sauteed green bell pepper, onion, or mushrooms for extra flavor and color.<br><br><b>SERVES 4</b><br><br>One 12-ounce package Johnsonville Vermont Maple Syrup Links<br>One 16-ounce jar thick and chunky salsa<br>One 12-inch prebaked pizza crust<br>3 eggs, scrambled<br>4 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded<br>1. Prepare the links according to the package instructions. Drain and slice.<br>2. Preheat the oven to 450�F.<br>3. Spread the salsa evenly over the pizza crust. Place the eggs evenly over the salsa, and cover with the sliced links.<br>4. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the pizza, and bake for 8 to 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden brown.<br><b>APPLE AND SAUSAGE CREPES FOSTER</b><br><br>This is our take on the traditional crepes Foster. Instead of bananas, we use a scrumptious blend of brown sugar, honey, Granny Smith apples, apple butter, juicy Johnsonville Brown Sugar &amp; Honey Links, and apple liqueur. Topped with cinnamon, confectioners' sugar, toasted pecans, and pomegranate seeds, Apple and Sausage Crepes Foster also makes a heavenly dessert.<br>Cornstarch slurry is used to thicken sauces, gravies, pie fillings, and puddings. It is made by whisking together equal parts cornstarch and a cold liquid, such as water.<br><br><b>SERVES 4</b><br><br>13 Johnsonville Brown Sugar &amp; Honey Links<br><br>CREPES<br>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br>1 teaspoon salt<br>2 cups milk<br>4 large eggs<br><br>FILLING<br>1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>3/4 cup brown sugar<br>1/4 cup honey<br>2 1/2 cups peeled and diced Granny Smith apples<br>1/4 cup apple butter<br>1/4 cup cornstarch slurry (see headnote)<br>1/2 cup Calvados or other apple liqueur<br>1 teaspoon cinnamon<br>1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar<br>1/2 cup pecans, toasted<br>1/2 cup pomegranate seeds<br>1. Prepare the links according to the package instructions. Allow to cool slightly. Slice into 1/4-inch coins.<br><br>2. To make the crepes: In a medium bowl, mix together the flour and salt.<br><br>3. In a large bowl, gently whisk together the milk and eggs. Gradually add the flour mixture to the egg mixture, stirring until it becomes smooth. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour, so that the flour swells and the air beaten into the batter dissipates. If the batter becomes too thick, add a bit more milk.<br><br>4. Heat an 8-inch nonstick saute or crepe pan over low heat. Pour 2 tablespoons of the batter into the pan, lifting and tilting it to spread the batter evenly. Cook until golden brown around the edges, about 30 seconds. Gently flip the crepe, and cook for another 30 seconds. Invert onto paper toweling. Repeat with the remaining batter, making 16 crepes total.<br><br>5. To make the filling: Melt 1/4 cup of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and honey. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute. Add 1 cup water, the apples, and apple butter. Allow to simmer for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sausage and slurry. Cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid is the consistency of honey.<br><br>6. Place 2 tablespoons of the filling on one-quarter of each crepe. Fold in half, and then in half once again, so that the crepes resemble triangles.<br><br>7. Place a bit of the remaining butter into a medium saute pan and melt over medium heat. Place four crepes into the pan, and carefully drizzle with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the liqueur. Cook for 30 seconds on each side. Repeat with the remaining crepes, adding more butter as necessary.<br><br>8. Serve sprinkled with the cinnamon, granulated sugar, and confectioners' sugar. Garnish with the pecans and pomegranate seeds.</p><h2>To the Pacific With Lewis and Clark (American Heritage Junior Library)</h2><p>Follows the journey of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark up the Missouri River to the Pacific as they charted the vast territory of the Louisiana Purchase.</p><p></p><h2>Even White Boys Get the Blues</h2><p>Cartoons featuring Kudzu Dubose and the people of Bypass, N.C. depict life in the contemporary South</p><p></p><h2>A Natural Curiosity</h2><p>Mysteries explained have fateful results for three women in present-day England, as one struggles to find a friend taken hostage, one investigates her mother&#39;s death, and one befriends a mass murderer</p><p>&#x201c;A brilliantly accomplished and wonderfully entertaining morality tale for our times.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Vancouver Province<br></i> <br>&#x201c;Drabble&#x2019;s observations are everywhere translated into a wry humour with a bite that bruises more than tragedy itself.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Globe and Mail<br></i> <br>&#x201c;Clearly a novelist with a social conscience, and with a firm grasp on the hearts and minds of the English middle class, Drabble is like a contemporary Dickens.&#x201d; <br>&#x2013; <i>Toronto Star<br></i> <br>&#x201c;[Drabble creates] a fascinating cross-section of convincing imaginary lives.

Mrs. Bradley received her B.A. in 1964 from Hardin Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, then did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1965-67.<p>She was a science fiction/fantasy fan from her middle teens, and made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in <i>Fantastic/Amazing Stories</i> in 1949. She had written as long as she could remember, but wrote only for school magazines and fanzines until 1952, when she sold her first professional short story to <i>Vortex Science Fiction</i>. She wrote everything from science fiction to Gothics, but is probably best known for her Darkover novels.</p><p>In addition to her novels, Mrs. Bradley edited many magazines, amateur and professional, including <i>Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine</i>, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called <i>Sword and Sorceress</i> for DAW Books.</p><p>Over the years she turned more to fantasy; The House Between the Worlds, although a selection of the Science Fiction Book Club, was "fantasy undiluted". She wrote a novel of the women in the Arthurian legends -- Morgan Le Fay, the Lady of the Lake, and others -- entitled <i>Mists of Avalon</i>, which made the NY Times best seller list both in hardcover and trade paperback, and she also wrote <i>The Firebrand</i>, a novel about the women of the Trojan War. Her historical fantasy novels, <i>The Forest House</i>, <i>Lady of Avalon</i>, <i>Mists of Avalon</i> are prequels to<i> Priestess of Avalon</i></p><p>She died in Berkeley, California on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a major heart attack.

The Terran Empire, like every process of human endeavor, was geometric rather than linear in this progression. It began with a few isolated star systems and planets; they in turn developed, put forth colonies, and then began to burgeon, effloresce, grow in wild and unrestrained proliferation. Within a thousand years a detached scientist might compare their growth&#x2014;from a perspective of millennia&#x2014;to that of the spread of the water hyacinth on Earth in the pre-space days; first an isolated phenomenon, then a study in wild growth, finally a menace that threatened to encompass and crowd out everything else.</p><p>Something of the same momentum can be seen in the isolated progress of the Terran Empire on a single planet. First a small scientific outpost, then a colony, a Trade City&#x2014;</p><p>Darkover, isolated at the edge of a galaxy, with a sun so dim that its name was known only in star catalogs, had halted in the first stages of this isolation for a hundred years.</p><p>But now&#x2014;look out, Darkover! For the worldwreckers are coming.</p><p>&#x2014;M.Z.B.</p><p><i>THE PLANET<br>SAVERS</i></p><p>CHAPTER ONE</p><p>By the time I got myself all the way awake I thought I was alone. I was lying on a leather couch in a bare white room with huge windows, alternate glass-brick and clear glass. Beyond the clear windows was a view of snow-peaked mountains which turned to pale shadows in the glass-brick.</p><p>Habit and memory fitted names to all these. The large office, the orange flare of the great sun, the names of the dimming mountains. But beyond a polished glass desk, a man sat watching me. And I had never seen the man before.</p><p>He was chubby, and not young, and had ginger-colored eyebrows and a fringe of ginger-colored hair around the edges of a forehead which was otherwise quite pink and bald. He was wearing a white uniform coat, and the intertwined caduceus on the pocket and on the sleeve proclaimed him a member of the Medical Service attached to the Civilian HQ of the Terran Trade City.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t stop to make all these evaluations consciously, of course. They were just part of my world when I woke up and found it taking shape around me. The familiar mountains, the familiar sun, the strange man. But he spoke to me in a friendly way, as if it were an ordinary thing to find a perfect stranger sprawled out taking a siesta in here.</p><p>&#x201c;Could I trouble you to tell me your name?&#x201d;</p><p>That was reasonable enough. If I found somebody making himself at home in my office&#x2014;if I had an office&#x2014;I&#x2019;d ask him his name, too. I started to swing my legs to the floor, and had to stop and steady myself with one hand while the room drifted in giddy circles around me.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t try to sit up just yet,&#x201d; he remarked, while the floor calmed down again. Then he repeated, politely but insistently, &#x201c;Your name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes. My name.&#x201d; It was&#x2014;I fumbled through layers of what felt like gray fuzz, trying to lay my tongue on the most familiar of all sounds, my own name. It was&#x2014;why, it was&#x2014;I said, on a high rising note, &#x201c;This is damn silly,&#x201d; and swallowed. And swallowed again. Hard.</p><p>&#x201c;Calm down,&#x201d; the chubby man said soothingly. That was easier said than done. I stared at him in growing panic and demanded, &#x201c;But, but, have I had amnesia or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or something.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s my <i>name?</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Now, now, take it easy! I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll remember it soon enough. You can answer other questions, I&#x2019;m sure. How old are you?&#x201d;</p><p>I answered eagerly and quickly, &#x201c;Twenty-two.&#x201d;</p><p>The chubby man scribbled something on a card. &#x201c;Interesting. In-ter-est-ing. Do you know where we are?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked around the office. &#x201c;In the Terran Headquarters. From your uniform, I&#x2019;d say we were on Floor 8&#x2014;Medical.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded and scribbled again, pursing his lips. &#x201c;Can you&#x2014;uh&#x2014;tell me what planet we are on?&#x201d;</p><p>I had to laugh. &#x201c;Darkover,&#x201d; I chuckled, &#x201c;I hope! And if you want the names of the moons, or the date of the founding of the Trade City, or something&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>He gave in, laughing with me. &#x201c;Remember where you were born?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On Samarra. I came here when I was three years old&#x2014;my father was in Mapping and Exploring&#x2014;&#x201d; I stopped short, in shock. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you tell me your father&#x2019;s name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same as mine. Jay&#x2014;Jason&#x2014;&#x201d; the flash of memory closed down in the middle of a word. It had been a good try, but it hadn&#x2019;t quite worked. The doctor said soothingly, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re doing very well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t told me anything,&#x201d; I accused. &#x201c;Who are you? Why are you asking me all these questions?&#x201d;</p><p>He pointed to a sign on his desk. I scowled and spelled out the letters. &#x201c;Randall&#x2014;Forth&#x2014;Director&#x2014;Department&#x2014;&#x201d; and Dr. Forth made a note. I said aloud, &#x201c;It is&#x2014;<i>Doctor</i> Forth, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know?&#x201d;</p><p>I looked down at myself, and shook my head. &#x201c;Maybe <i>I&#x2019;m</i> Doctor Forth,&#x201d; I said, noticing for the first time that I was also wearing a white coat with the caduceus emblem of Medical. But it had the wrong feel, as if I were dressed in somebody else&#x2019;s clothes. I was no doctor, was I? I pushed back one sleeve slightly, exposing a long, triangular scar under the cuff. Dr. Forth&#x2014;by now I was sure <i>he</i> was Dr. Forth&#x2014;followed the direction of my eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you get the scar?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Knife fight. One of the bands of those-who-may-not-enter-cities caught us on the slopes, and we&#x2014;&#x201d; the memory thinned out again, and I said despairingly, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all confused! What&#x2019;s the matter? Why am I up on Medical? Have I had an accident? Amnesia?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not exactly, I&#x2019;ll explain.&#x201d;</p><p>I got up and walked to the window, unsteadily because my feet wanted to walk slowly while I felt like bursting through some invisible net and striding there at one bound. Once I got to the window the room stayed put while I gulped down great breaths of warm sweetish air. I said, &#x201c;I could use a drink.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good idea. Though I don&#x2019;t usually recommend it.&#x201d; Forth reached into a drawer for a flat bottle; poured tea-colored liquid into a throwaway cup. After a minute he poured more for himself. &#x201c;Here. And sit down, man. You make me nervous, hovering like that.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t sit down. I strode to the door and flung it open. Forth&#x2019;s voice was low and unhurried.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? You can go out, if you want to, but won&#x2019;t you sit down and talk to me for a minute? Anyway, where do you want to go?&#x201d;</p><p>The question made me uncomfortable. I took a couple of long breaths and came back into the room. Forth said, &#x201c;Drink this,&#x201d; and I poured it down. He refilled the cup unasked, and I swallowed that too and felt the hard lump in my middle began to loosen up and dissolve.</p><p>Forth said, &#x201c;Claustrophobia too. Typical,&#x201d; and scribbled on the card some more. I was getting tired of that performance. I turned on him to tell him so, then suddenly felt amused&#x2014;or maybe it was the liquor working in me. He seemed such a funny little man, shutting himself up inside an office like this and talking about claustrophobia and watching me as if I were a big bug. I tossed the cup into a disposal.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it about time for a few of those explanations?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If you think you can take it. How do you feel now?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; I sat down on the couch again, leaning back and stretching out my long legs comfortably. &#x201c;What did you put in that drink?&#x201d;</p><p>He chuckled. &#x201c;Trade secret. Now, the easiest way to explain would be to let you watch a film we made yesterday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To watch&#x2014;&#x201d; I stopped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s your time we&#x2019;re wasting.&#x201d;</p><p>He punched a button on the desk, spoke into a mouthpiece. &#x201c;Surveillance? Give us a monitor on&#x2014;&#x201d; he spoke a string of incomprehensible numbers, while I lounged at ease on the couch. Forth waited for an answer, then touched another button and steel louvers closed noiselessly over the windows, blacking them out. The darkness felt oddly more normal than the light, and I leaned back and watched the flickers clear as one wall of the office became a large vision-screen. Forth came and sat beside me on the leather couch, but in the picture Forth was there, sitting at his desk, watching another man, a stranger, walk into the office.</p><p>Like Forth, the newcomer wore a white coat with the caduceus emblems. I disliked the man on sight. He was tall and lean and composed, with a dour face set in thin lines. I guessed that he was somewhere in his thirties. Dr. Forth-in-the-film said, &#x201c;Sit back, doctor,&#x201d; and I drew a long breath, overwhelmed by a curious sensation.</p><p><i>I have been here before. I have seen this happen before</i>.</p><p>(And curiously formless I felt. I sat and watched, and I knew I was watching, and sitting. But it was in that dreamlike fashion, where the dreamer at once watches his visions and participates in them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.)</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down, doctor,&#x201d; Forth said. &#x201c;Did you bring in the reports?&#x201d;</p><p>Jay Allison carefully took the indicated seat, poised nervously on the edge of the chair. He sat very straight, leaning forward only a little to hand a thick folder of papers across the desk. Forth took it, but didn&#x2019;t open it. &#x201c;What do you think, Dr. Allison?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There is no possible room for doubt.&#x201d; Jay Allison spoke precisely, in a rather high-pitched and emphatic tone. &#x201c;It follows the statistical pattern for all recorded attacks of forty-eight-year fever&#x2014;by the way, sir, haven&#x2019;t we any better name than that for this particular disease? The term &#x2018;forty-eight-year fever&#x2019; connotes a fever of forty-eight years&#x2019; duration, rather than a pandemic recurring every forty-eight years.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A fever that lasted forty-eight years would be quite a fever,&#x201d; Dr. Forth said with a grim smile. &#x201c;Nevertheless that&#x2019;s the only name we have so far. Name it and you can have it. Allison&#x2019;s disease?&#x201d;</p><p>Jay Allison greeted this pleasantry with a repressive frown. &#x201c;As I understand it, the disease cycle seems to be connected somehow with the once-every-forty-eight-years&#x2019; conjunction of the four moons, which explains why the Darkovans are so superstitious about it. The moons have remarkably eccentric orbits&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know anything about that part, I&#x2019;m quoting Dr. Moore. If there&#x2019;s an animal vector to the disease, we&#x2019;ve never discovered it. The pattern runs like this; a few cases in the mountain districts, the next month a hundred-odd cases all over this part of the planet. Then it skips exactly three months without increase. The next upswing puts the number of the reported case in the thousands, and three months after <i>that</i>, it reaches real pandemic proportions and decimates the entire human population of Darkover.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s about it,&#x201d; Forth admitted. They bent together over the folder, Jay Allison drawing back slightly to avoid touching the other man.</p><p>Forth said, &#x201c;We Terrans have had a Trade compact on Darkover for a hundred and fifty-two years. The first outbreak of this forty-eight-year fever killed all but a dozen men out of three hundred. The Darkovans were worse off than we were. The last outbreak wasn&#x2019;t as bad, but it was bad enough, I&#x2019;ve heard. It had an eighty-seven percent mortality&#x2014;for humans, that is. I understand the trailmen don&#x2019;t die of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Darkovans call it the trailmen&#x2019;s fever, Dr. Forth, because the trailmen are virtually immune to it. It remains in their midst as a mild ailment taken by children. When it breaks out into a virulent form every forty-eight years, most of the trailmen are already immune. I took the disease myself as a child&#x2014;maybe you heard?&#x201d;</p><p>Forth nodded. &#x201c;You may be the only Terran ever to contract the disease and survive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The trailmen incubate the disease,&#x201d; Jay Allison said. &#x201c;I should think the logical thing would be to drop a couple of hydrogen bombs on the trail cities&#x2014;and wipe it out for good and all.&#x201d;</p><p>(Sitting on the sofa in Forth&#x2019;s dark office, I stiffened with such fury that he shook my shoulder and muttered &#x201c;Easy, there, man!&#x201d;)</p><p>Dr. Forth, on the screen, looked annoyed, and Jay Allison said, with a grimace of distaste, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean that literally. But the Trailmen are not human. It wouldn&#x2019;t be genocide, just an exterminator&#x2019;s job. A public health measure.&#x201d;</p><p>Forth looked shocked as he realized that the younger man meant what he was saying. He said, &#x201c;Galactic Center would have to rule on whether they&#x2019;re dumb animals or intelligent nonhumans, and whether they&#x2019;re entitled to the status of a civilization. All precedent on Darkover is toward recognizing them as men&#x2014;and good God, Jay, you&#x2019;d probably be called as a witness for the defense! How can you say they&#x2019;re not human after your experience with them? Anyway, by the time their status was finally decided, half of the recognizable humans on Darkover would be dead. We need a better solution than that.&#x201d;</p><p>He pushed his chair...</p></p><h2>Winterdance: Fine Madness of Alaskan Dog-racing</h2><p>Paulsen and his team of dogs endured snowstorms, frostbite, dogfights, moose attacks, sleeplessness, and hallucinations in the relentless push to go on.

Despite the fact that it's often a hard sell at first (what teenager wouldn't cringe at the thought of 400-plus pages of talking rabbits?), Richard Adams's bunny-centric epic rarely fails to win the love and respect of anyone who reads it, regardless of age. Like most great novels, <i>Watership Down</i> is a rich story that can be read (and reread) on many different levels. The book is often praised as an allegory, with its analogs between human and rabbit culture (a fact sometimes used to goad skeptical teens, who resent the challenge that they won't "get" it, into reading it), but it's equally praiseworthy as just a corking good adventure.<p> The story follows a warren of Berkshire rabbits fleeing the destruction of their home by a land developer. As they search for a safe haven, skirting danger at every turn, we become acquainted with the band and its compelling culture and mythos. Adams has crafted a touching, involving world in the dirt and scrub of the English countryside, complete with its own folk history and language (the book comes with a "lapine" glossary, a guide to rabbitese). As much about freedom, ethics, and human nature as it is about a bunch of bunnies looking for a warm hidey-hole and some mates, <i>Watership Down</i> will continue to make the transition from classroom desk to bedside table for many generations to come. <i>--Paul Hughes</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Holy Books Have a History: Textual Histories of the New Testament and the Qur&#39;an</h2><p>Holy Books is a study of textual histories of the New Testament and Qur&#39;an based on study of their earliest available manuscripts.</p><p></p><h2>The Lady of Tarpon Springs</h2><p>Much to the dismay of her Greek family, Zanna Krykos makes a living as a lawyer in Tarpon Springs, Florida.

This is why there is no evidence for these monarchs in the archaeology of modern Israel; for the evidence, including the tombs, sarcophagi and death-masks of these famous monarchs, are actually located in the north eastern Nile Delta.&nbsp;The Queen of Sheba was also related to this royal line and, as befitting the great 'Queen of the South', her sarcophagus was discovered at Deir el Bahri in Luxor. The book also shows the location of King Solomon's Mines and the true historical identity of Hiram Abif, the hero of the Masonic 3rd degree.</p><p>The claims in this books are controversial and far-reaching, sufficiently so that many readers may be tempted to dismiss them out of hand. However, the book is very well researched and documented, and considering the dramatic claims that are being made, it is very surprising to see such a wealth of information that supports this hypothesis. Indeed, the history of the United Monarchy makes a great deal more sense under this new Egyptian interpretation than it ever did under the classical biblical explanation.</p><h2>Ladybug Girl At the Beach</h2><p>Children&#39;s book.</p><p></p><h2>Let Me Lie: Being in the Main an Ethnological Account of the Remarkable (The Virginia Bookshelf) (The Virginia Bookshelf Series)</h2><p><p>When <i>Let Me Lie</i> was first published in 1947, most reviewers missed the double meaning of the book's title.

When her most famous story, <em>The Awakening</em>, was first published in 1899, it stunned readers with its frank portrayal of the inner word of Edna Pontellier, and its daring criticisms of the limits of marriage and motherhood. The subtle beauty of her writing was contrasted with her unwomanly and sordid subject-matter: Edna's rejection of her domestic role, and her passionate quest for spiritual, sexual, and artistic freedom.<br> From her first stories, Chopin was interested in independent characters who challenged convention. This selection, freshly edited from the first printing of each text, enables readers to follow her unfolding career as she experimented with a broad range of writing, from tales for children to decadent <em>fin-de siecle</em> sketches. <em>The Awakening</em> is set alongside thirty-two short stories, illustrating the spectrum of the fiction from her first published stories to her 1898 secret masterpiece, "The Storm."</p><p>First published in 1899, this beautiful, brief novel so disturbed critics and the public that it was banished for decades afterward. Now widely read and admired, <i>The Awakening</i> has been hailed as an early vision of woman's emancipation. This sensuous book tells of a woman's abandonment of her family, her seduction, and her awakening to desires and passions that threated to consumer her. Originally entitled "A Solitary Soul," this portrait of twenty-eight-year-old Edna Pontellier is a landmark in American fiction, rooted firmly in the romantic tradition of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson. Here, a woman in search of self-discovery turns away from convention and society, and toward the primal, from convention and society, and toward the primal, irresistibly attracted to nature and the senses<i>The Awakening</i>, Kate Chopin's last novel, has been praised by Edmund Wilson as "beautifully written." And Willa Cather described its style as "exquisite," "sensitive," and "iridescent." This edition of <i>The Awakening</i> also includes a selection of short stories by Kate Chopin. <p>"This seems to me a higher order of feminism than repeating the story of woman as victim...

Reprint.</p><p>One of the first black women to star in a television series (``Star Trek'') provides a valuable commentary on racism in the business, along with numerous sugarcoated stories about friends, fans, and family. Growing up in Robbins, a black-populated and black-governed town just outside of Chicago, Nichols began her singing and dancing career at the age of 14, touring nightclubs for many years. Nichols met Gene Roddenberry, later the producer of ``Star Trek,'' in 1963 when she was cast in an episode of one of his early television series. Her friendship with the married Roddenberry quickly turned into an affair. Nichols ended it when she discovered he was seeing someone else, although by her account, Roddenberry never quite forgave her for walking away. Nichols faced numerous racial and sexist barriers throughout her career, including conflict with the stuffed shirts of NBC around her role in ``Star Trek.'' Only after Nichols agreed to sign the contract did NBC executives learn that Roddenberry intended to hire a black woman as fourth in command on the Enterprise. They refused to honor the contract, but Roddenberry was free to hire her on a daily basis, which he did throughout the series. Nichols admits having felt humiliated not to be working under the same terms as the rest of the cast. Nichols also reveals the rocky relationship she and the entire cast had with William Shatner. Even though she occasionally offers kind words about Shatner's character and abilities, for the most part he is portrayed as arrogant and bossy. Nichols occasionally takes herself too seriously. Her speeches at ``Star Trek'' conventions often addressed the future of the space program. By her account, ``often, by the end of my speech, the fans would be crying, and I would be crying. Then we'd all be laughing.'' Nichols's story just doesn't have the expected punch from the woman involved with the first televised interracial kiss. But Trekkers will love the gossip. (40 b&amp;w photos, not seen) (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Famous as <i>Star Trek</i>'s Lieutenant Uhura, Nichols has lived long and prospered in quite a number of other endeavors besides acting, including singing, several varieties of dancing, songwriting, minority recruitment for NASA, space advocacy, and as an African American role model, wife, mother, daughter, and no-nonsense human being. The granddaughter of a slaveowner's son who married an African American woman more than a century ago and the daughter of a man who faced down one of Al Capone's hit squads, she has personally survived discrimination, family feuds, Hollywood, brushes with both the Mob and rape, and 30 years of the ups and downs of <i>Star Trek</i> (she is a definite partisan of Gene Roddenberry--hardly surprising, perhaps, since they considered marriage). Her frankness on all these matters eliminates any need for a future unauthorized biography. This fascinating and delightful book by and about someone who comes across as fascinating and delightful herself is a vital addition to both <i>Star Trek</i> literature and African American studies. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Book Lover&#39;s Borrow Book</h2><p>The books you lend are usually the ones you least want to lose.

In the studies in this volume, famous artist and art instructor Reginald Marsh brought his genius to bear on the complex problem of life drawing. Delving into the work of the great masters (Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Rubens, Poussin, D�rer, Holbein, and others), Marsh simplified, abstracted, adapted, and reinterpreted their work into a collection of drawings both immensely interesting and instructive to the practicing artist and the student. <br>The 209 pages of drawings in this volume show the human body in a wide variety of positions, viewed from many different angles. Marsh directs special attention to those angles, aspects, and physical positions which are the most difficult to portray. His great talent, coupled with a rare ability to instruct others (Marsh taught at the Art Students League for many years) gave him unusual sensitivity to the concerns of the artist in life drawing: his concise commentary on the drawing points up the problems addressed in each &#x2014; tone, movement, proportion, composition, etc. The front, side, back, head, arms and hands, legs and feet, and full figure drawings are all included. A separate section on the problems of proportion explores 7, 7 1/2, and 8 head schemes, providing an unusually workable and lucid treatment of the topic for the practicing artist. The body and parts of the body are drawn in skeleton, tissue and muscle, major bone structure, and as they appear in life. Marsh studied medical anatomy as well as the work of the great medical artists in order to perfect his knowledge of human anatomy. <br>All of the hundreds of drawings, figures, and details of this volume have been excellently reproduced in this edition. The last 95 drawings in the book are all original studies by Marsh, never before published in book form. These casual, light-hearted drawings (mostly of female nudes) illustrate both Marsh's seemingly easy mastery of the techniques of life drawing, and his characteristic lusty, Rubenesque style. Because they are so distinctly in his own style, these drawings highlight the great scope and knowledgeability he has shown in the earlier instructive studies. Those who know and admire Marsh as an artist, as well as anyone who wishes to learn to draw from life, will find this volume indispensable. <br></p><p></p><h2>When the Stars Went to War:: Hollywood and World War II</h2><p>Interweaving the reminiscences of numerous actors, actresses, studio heads, and others, an account of Hollywood during World War II chronicles USO tours, bond drives, and combat experiences</p><p>In this fascinating look at Hollywood at war, Hoopes examines the roles the stars played and the effect they had both overseas and on the home front. From the moment the bombs dropped on Pearl Harbor, Hollywood answered the call with what Hoopes calls "equal measures of patriotism and egotism." Naturally, the book has a star-studded cast: Gable, Hope, Hepburn, Crawford, Davis--they're all here, more stars than there are in the heavens, as MGM publicity used to say. Some of the stories are familiar, such as the ill-fated war bond drive that ended with the death of Carole Lombard, but some are virtually unknown, such as the intense anti-Nazi campaign led by Edward G. Robinson (born Emmanuel Goldenberg). Hoopes also brings to light the appalling treatment of black entertainers, who endured the same second-class treatment as black servicemen. At one stop, Lena Horne was giving a separate show for black soldiers when she noticed a group of white men seated in the front row. Who were these VIPs? German prisoners of war. Both movie fans and military history buffs will enjoy this rare combination of nostalgia and substance. <i>Ilene Cooper</i>This vastly entertaining book covers the WWII activities of Hollywood's best-known stars. Hoopes identifies those who received legitimate deferments, those who had strings pulled on their behalf by studio heads and those who joined the armed forces and saw action. But the bulk of the book deals with the experiences of stars who took part in war-bond drives and USO tours, and describes the acts performed by such troop-entertainers as Humphrey Bogart, Gary Cooper and Edward G. Robinson. Hoopes explains that the Hollywood Canteen came into being largely through the initiative of John Garfield and Bette Davis and developed into a much-appreciated club where the lowest-ranking GI could drop in for a chat with-and be served refreshments by-a "real live movie star." The book is jammed with breezy quips, one-liners and polished show-biz anecdotes. Hoopes is Washington bureau chief of Modern Maturity. Photos.

Topics include: * Be creative in your rebellion * Start a mutual listening club * Notice your parents doing things right * Be okay with your bad hair day * Turn down the drama meter * Don&#39;t sweat the future</p><p>Richard Carlson has written numerous books encouraging folks not to "sweat the small stuff", and his title for teens is as warm, wise, and witty as his previous works. His tone is one of an older family friend who manages to advise while still maintaining the minimum level of coolness that teens require from those who intend to guide them into adulthood. <p> With 100 different chapters, each just a few pages in length, this little book works especially well as a bedside companion or tucked in a backpack for the morning commute to school. Each chapter is devoted to a single, simple idea such as "trust your inner signals" and "root for the underdog," and plenty of real-life examples from teens are used to illustrate principles. In the second chapter, a teen volunteering at an animal shelter is used to show how just one person can make a difference, as she takes the time for one more phone call that results in saving a dog's life. The concepts are appropriate for both early high school students and new graduates--who doesn't need an occasional reminder to "be ok with your bad hair day"? Incorporating sports, theater, literature, video games, teachers, and parents into stories make these examples accessible to kids of all interests, and a sprinkling of tales from the author's own teenage years adds an effective personal note. With plenty of suggestions for adding activities into a teen's life--volunteer opportunities in particular--your child may even feel encouraged to seek out new forms of positive expression simply for the joy of the activity, rather than the old standbys of "my friends are doing it" or "I need it to get into college." <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>Best-selling author Richard Carlson, Ph.D., creator of the popular Don&#39;t Sweat the Small Stuff series and the just published Don&#39;t Get Scrooged, died suddenly of cardiac arrest enroute to New York on December 13. Carlson, 45, published his first book in 1985 and went on to publish more than 20 books that remain popular in English and in translation in 130 languages and 35 countries. Richard Carlson grew up in Piedmont, CA. He received his undergraduate degree from Pepperdine University and his Ph.D. in psychology from Sierra University. He was in private practice as a psychotherapist when he started to publish books about psychological and spiritual health. As his books started to attract a large audience, he began writing full time so he could teach more people how to live with presence and ease by cultivating gratitude and generosity. Dr. Carlson was a large supporter of and participant in the National Center for Family Literacy and at the time of his death he was working on a project with them called for &#34;A Penny a Book&#34; from publishers, authors and literary agents to promote literacy. Dr. Carlson is survived by his wife and life partner of 25 years, Kris Carlson, his co-author on Don&#39;t Sweat the Small Stuff in Love and the author of Don&#39;t Sweat the Small Stuff for Women, his loving daughters Jasmine and Kenna, sisters, Kathleen Carlson Mowris of Olympic Village, CA and Anna L. Carlson of La Selva Beach, CA, and his parents, Barbara and Don Carlson of Orinda, CA. A private memorial service will be held next week.

He has written for <i>National Geographic</i>, <i>GQ</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, and <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Magazine</i>. He lives in western Montana.<b>Chapter 16</b><br><br>Knight lived in the dirt but was cleaner than you. Way cleaner. Pine needles and mud don&#x2019;t make you dirty, except superficially. The muck that matters, the bad bacteria, the evil virus, is typically passed through coughs and sneezes and handshakes and kisses. The price of sociability is sometimes our health. Knight quarantined himself from the human race and thus avoided our biohazards. He stayed phenomenally healthy. Though he suffered deeply at times, he insists he never once had a medical emergency, or a serious illness, or a bad accident, or even a cold.<br><br>During the summers, especially in the early years, he was strong, fit, and spry. &#x201c;You should have seen me in my twenties&#x2014;I ruled the land I walked upon, it was mine,&#x201d; Knight said, exposing the prideful streak that runs below his surface of contrition. &#x201c;Why shouldn&#x2019;t I claim it as my own? No one else was there. I was in control. I controlled it as much as I wanted. I was lord of the woods.&#x201d;<br><br>Poison ivy grows throughout the area; its prevalence prevented some people from searching for his site. Knight kept&nbsp;a little jingle in his head&#x2014;&#x201c;leaves of three, let it be&#x201d;&#x2014;and so ably memorized where each patch grew that even at night he didn&#x2019;t brush against it. He says he was never once afflicted.<br><br>Lyme disease, a bacterial illness transmitted through tick bites that can cause partial paralysis, is endemic to central Maine, but Knight was spared that as well. He brooded about Lyme for a while, then came to a realization: &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t do anything about it, so I stopped thinking about it.&#x201d;<br><br>Living in the woods, subject to the whims of nature, offers a great deal of autonomy but not much control. At first, Knight worried about everything: snowstorms might bury him, hikers could find him, the police would capture him. Gradually, methodically, he shed most of his anxiety.<br><br>But not all. Being too relaxed, he felt, was also a danger. In appropriate doses, worry was useful, possibly lifesaving. &#x201c;I used worry to encourage thought,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Worry can give you an extra prod to survive and plan. And I had to plan.&#x201d;<br><br>At the conclusion of each thieving mission, he was absolved temporarily of worry. The order in which he ate his food was governed by the pace of spoilage, ground beef to Twinkies. When he was down to little more than flour and shortening, he&#x2019;d mix those together with water and make biscuits. He never stole homemade meals or unwrapped items, for fear someone might poison him, so everything he took came sealed in a carton or can. He ate every morsel, scraping the containers clean. Then he deposited the wrappers and cartons in his camp&#x2019;s dump, stuffed between boulders at the boundary of his site.<br><br>The dump was scattered over an area of about a hundred&nbsp;square feet. One section was devoted to items like propane tanks and old mattresses and sleeping bags and books, another to food containers. Even in the food area, there was no odor. Knight added layers of dirt and leaves to aid with composting, which eliminated any smell, but most of the packaging was waxed cardboard or plastic, slow to disintegrate. Upon excavation, the colors on many boxes remained garish, superlatives and exclamation points and rococo typography popping from the soil while robins chirped in the branches above.<br><br>The archeological record contained in his dump revealed why Knight&#x2019;s only significant health issue was his teeth. He brushed regularly, he stole toothpaste, but did not see a dentist and his teeth began to rot. It didn&#x2019;t help that his culinary preferences never progressed beyond the sugar-and-processedfood palate of a teenager. &#x201c; &#x2018;Cooking&#x2019; is too kind a word for what I did,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>A staple meal was macaroni and cheese. Dozens of macand-cheese boxes were buried between the rocks, along with several empty spice bottles&#x2014;black pepper, garlic powder, hot sauce, blackened seasoning. Often, when Knight was inside a cabin with a good spice rack, he would grab a new bottle and try it out on his macaroni and cheese.<br><br>Also in his dump was a flattened thirty-ounce container from cheddar-flavored Goldfish crackers, a five-pound tub from Marshmallow Fluff, and a box that had held sixteen Drake&#x2019;s Devil Dogs. There were packages from graham crackers, tater tots, baked beans, shredded cheese, hot dogs, maple syrup, chocolate bars, cookie dough. Betty Crocker scalloped potatoes and Tyson chicken strips. Country Time&nbsp;lemonade and Mountain Dew. El Monterey spicy jalape�o and cheese chimichangas.<br><br>All of this came from a single kitchen-sink-sized hole, dug out by hand. Knight had fled the modern world only to live off the fat of it. The food, Knight pointed out, wasn&#x2019;t exactly his choice. It was first selected by the cabin owners of North Pond, then snatched by him. He did steal a little money, an average of fifteen dollars a year&#x2014;&#x201c;a backup system,&#x201d; he called it&#x2014;and lived an hour&#x2019;s walk from the Sweet Dreams convenience store and deli, but never went there. The last time he ate at a restaurant, or even sat at a table, was at some fast-food place during his final road trip.<br><br>He stole frozen lasagna, canned ravioli, and Thousand Island dressing. You can dig in the dump until you&#x2019;re lying on your side, arm buried to the shoulder, and more keeps emerging. Cheetos and bratwurst and pudding and pickles. Quarry a trench deep enough to fight a war from&#x2014;Crystal Light, Cool Whip, Chock full o&#x2019;Nuts, Coke&#x2014;and you still won&#x2019;t reach bottom.<br><br>So he wasn&#x2019;t a gourmet. He didn&#x2019;t care what he ate. &#x201c;The discipline I practiced in order to survive did away with cravings for specific food. As long as it was food, it was good enough.&#x201d; He spent no more than a few minutes preparing meals, yet he often passed the fortnight between raids without leaving camp, filling much of the time with chores, camp maintenance, hygiene, and entertainment.<br><br>His chief form of entertainment was reading. The last moments he was in a cabin were usually spent scanning bookshelves and nightstands. The life inside a book always felt&nbsp;welcoming to Knight. It pressed no demands on him, while the world of actual human interactions was so complex. Conversations between people can move like tennis games, swift and unpredictable. There are constant subtle visual and verbal cues, there&#x2019;s innuendo, sarcasm, body language, tone. Everyone occasionally fumbles an encounter, a victim of social clumsiness. It&#x2019;s part of being human.<br><br>To Knight, it all felt impossible. His engagement with the written word might have been the closest he could come to genuine human encounters. The stretch of days between thieving raids allowed him to tumble into the pages, and if he felt transported he could float in bookworld, undisturbed, for as long as he pleased.<br><br>The reading selection offered by the cabins was often dispiriting. With books, Knight did have specific desires and cravings&#x2014;in some ways, reading material was more important to him than food&#x2014;though when he was famished for words, he&#x2019;d subsist on whatever the nightstands bestowed, highbrow or low.<br><br>He liked Shakespeare,<i> Julius Caesar</i> especially, that litany of betrayal and violence. He marveled at the poetry of Emily Dickinson, sensing her kindred spirit. For the last seventeen years of her life, Dickinson rarely left her home in Massachusetts and spoke to visitors only through a partly closed door. &#x201c;Saying nothing,&#x201d; she wrote, &#x201c;sometimes says the most.&#x201d;<br><br>Knight wished he&#x2019;d been able to procure more poetry written by Edna St. Vincent Millay, a fellow native of Maine, born in the coastal village of Rockland in 1892. He quoted her bestknown lines&#x2014;&#x201c;My candle burns at both ends / It will not last&nbsp;the night&#x201d;&#x2014;and then added, &#x201c;I tried candles in my camp for a number of years. Not worth it to steal them.&#x201d;<br><br>If he were forced to select a favorite book, it might be <i>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</i>, by William Shirer. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s concise,&#x201d; Knight said, a quick twelve hundred pages, &#x201c;and impressive as any novel.&#x201d; He stole every book on military history he saw<br><br>He pilfered a copy of <i>Ulysses</i>, but it was possibly the one book he did not finish. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of it? I suspect it was a bit of a joke by Joyce. He just kept his mouth shut as people read into it more than there was. Pseudo-intellectuals love to drop the name <i>Ulysses </i>as their favorite book. I refused to be intellectually bullied into finishing it.&#x201d;<br><br>Knight&#x2019;s disdain for Thoreau was bottomless&#x2014;&#x201c;he had no deep insight into nature&#x201d;&#x2014;but Ralph Waldo Emerson was acceptable. &#x201c;People are to be taken in very small doses,&#x201d; wrote Emerson. &#x201c;Nothing can bring you peace but yourself.&#x201d; Knight read the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and felt a deep-rooted connection to the verses. &#x201c;Good walking,&#x201d; says the <i>Tao</i>, &#x201c;leaves no tracks.&#x201d;<br><br>Robert Frost received a thumbs-down&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad his reputation is starting to fade&#x201d;&#x2014;and Knight said that when he ran out of toilet paper, he sometimes tore pages from John Grisham novels. He mentioned that he didn&#x2019;t like Jack Kerouac either, but this wasn&#x2019;t quite true. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like people who like Jack Kerouac,&#x201d; he clarified.<br><br>Knight stole portable radios and earbuds and tuned in daily, voices through the waves another kind of human presence. For a while he was fascinated by talk radio. He listened to a lot of Rush Limbaugh. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t say I liked him. I said I&nbsp;listened to him.&#x201d; Knight&#x2019;s own politics were &#x201c;conservative but not Republican.&#x201d; He added, perhaps unnecessarily, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m kind of an isolationist.&#x201d;<br><br>Later he got hooked on classical music&#x2014;Brahms and Tchaikovsky, yes; Bach, no. &#x201c;Bach is too pristine,&#x201d; he said. Bliss for him was Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s<i> The Queen of Spades</i>. But his undying passion was classic rock: the Who, AC/DC, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and, above all, Lynyrd Skynyrd. Nothing in all the world received higher praise from Knight than Lynyrd Skynyrd. &#x201c;They will be playing Lynyrd Skynyrd songs in a thousand years,&#x201d; he proclaimed.<br><br>On one raid he stole a Panasonic black-and-white fiveinch-diagonal television. This was why he needed so many car and boat batteries&#x2014;to power the TV. Knight was adept at wiring batteries together, in series and parallel. He also carried off an antenna and hid it high in his treetops.<br><br>He said that everything shown on PBS was &#x201c;carefully crafted for liberal baby boomers with college degrees,&#x201d; but the best thing he watched while in the woods was a PBS program, Ken Burns&#x2019;s documentary <i>The Civil War</i>. He was able to recite parts of the show verbatim. &#x201c;I still remember Sullivan Ballou&#x2019;s letter to his wife,&#x201d; said Knight. &#x201c;It brought tears to my eyes.&#x201d; Ballou, a major in the Union army, wrote to Sarah on July 14, 1861, and was killed at the First Battle of Bull Run before the letter was delivered. The note spoke of &#x201c;unbounded love&#x201d; for his children, and Ballou said his heart was attached to his wife&#x2019;s &#x201c;with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break&#x201d;&#x2014;an expression of human connection that made Knight weep, even if he wasn&#x2019;t compelled to seek it himself.<br><br>Knight was aware of world events and politics, but he seldom had any reaction. Everything seemed to be happening far away. He burned through all his batteries after September 11, 2001, and never watched television again. &#x201c;Car batteries were so heavy and difficult to steal anyway,&#x201d; he said. He repurposed the ones he had as anchor weights for guylines, and after he stole a radio that received television audio signals, he switched to listening to TV stations on the radio; &#x201c;theater of the mind,&#x201d; he called it. <i>Seinfeld </i>and <i>Everybody Loves Raymond</i> were his television-on-the-radio favorites.<br><br>&#x201c;I do have a sense of humor,&#x201d; Knight said. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t like jokes. Freud said there&#x2019;s no such thing as a joke&#x2014;a joke is an expression of veiled hostility.&#x201d; His favorite comedians were the Marx Brothers, the Three Stooges, and George Carlin. The last movie he saw in a theater was the 1984 comedy <i>Ghostbusters</i>.<br><br>He never bothered listening to sports; they bored him, every one of them. For news, there were five-minute updates at the top of the hour on WTOS, the Mountain of Pure Rock, out of Augusta. Also, he said, he sometimes listened to French news stations out of Quebec. He didn&#x2019;t speak French, but he understood most of it.<br><br>He liked handheld video games. His rule for stealing them was that they had to appear outdated; he didn&#x2019;t want to take a kid&#x2019;s new one. He&#x2019;d be stealing those in a couple years anyway. He enjoyed Pok�mon, Tetris, and Dig Dug. &#x201c;I like games that require thought and strategy. No shoot-&#x2019;em-ups. No mindless repetitive motion.&#x201d; Electronic Sudoku was great, and crossword puzzles in magazines were welcome challenges, but he&nbsp;never took a deck of cards to play solitaire, and he doesn&#x2019;t like chess. &#x201c;Chess is too two-dimensional, too finite of a game.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t create any sort of art&#x2014;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not that type of person&#x201d;&#x2014;nor did he spend any nights away from his camp. &#x201c;I have no desire to travel. I read. That&#x2019;s my form of travel.&#x201d; He never even glimpsed Maine&#x2019;s celebrated coastline. He claimed that he did not speak to himself aloud, not a word. &#x201c;Oh, you mean like typical hermit behavior, huh? No, never.&#x201d;<br><br>Not for a moment did he consider keeping a journal. He would never allow anyone to read his private thoughts; therefore, he did not risk writing them down. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather take it to my grave,&#x201d; he said. And anyway, when was a journal ever honest? &#x201c;It either tells a lot of truths to cover a single lie,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;or a lot of lies to cover a single truth.&#x201d;<br><br>Knight&#x2019;s ability to hold a grudge was impressive. Though many <i>National Geographic</i> magazines were buried beneath his tent, he despised the publication. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t even like stealing them,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I only looked at them when I was desperate. They&#x2019;re really only good for burying in the dirt. That glossy paper lasts a long time.&#x201d;<br><br>His aversion to <i>National Geographic</i> extends back to his youth. When Knight was in high school, he was reading a copy and came across a photo of a young Peruvian shepherd standing beside a road, crying. Behind him were several dead sheep, struck by a car as the boy had been trying to guide them. The photograph was later reprinted in a book of <i>National Geographic</i>&#x2019;s all-time greatest portraits.<br><br>It incensed Knight. &#x201c;They published a photo of the boy&#x2019;s humiliation. He had failed his family, who had entrusted him&nbsp;with the herd. It&#x2019;s disgusting that everybody can see a little boy&#x2019;s failure.&#x201d; Knight, still furious about the image thirty years later, was a man acutely attuned to the ravages of shame. Had he done something shameful before he&#x2019;d fled to the forest? He insisted that he had not.<br><br>Knight had a strong distaste for big cities, filled with helpless intellectuals, people with multiple degrees who couldn&#x2019;t change a car&#x2019;s oil. But, he added, it wasn&#x2019;t as if rural areas were Valhalla. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t glorify the country,&#x201d; he said, then tossed off a line from the first chapter of <i>The Communist Manifesto</i> about escaping &#x201c;the idiocy of rural life.&#x201d;<br><br>He acknowledged, forthrightly, that a couple of cabins were enticing because of their subscriptions to <i>Playboy</i>. He was curious. He was only twenty years old when he disappeared, and had never been out on a date.

In 1972, Steelers star Franco Harris hitchhiked to practice. NFL teams roomed in skanky motels. They played on guts, painkillers, legal steroids, fury, and camaraderie. A decade later, Joe Montana&#x2019;s gleamingly efficient 49ers ushered in a new era: the corporate, scripted, multibillion-dollar NFL we watch today. Kevin Cook&#x2019;s rollicking chronicle of this pivotal decade draws on interviews with legendary players&#x2015;Harris, Montana, Terry Bradshaw, Roger Staubach, Ken &#x201c;Snake&#x201d; Stabler&#x2015;to re-create their heroics and off-field carousing.

A tireless worker for the light, he survived Hitler&#39;s concentration camples but died a victim of Communist persecution in 1958. He left behind him four legendary books which have become acknowledged classics of occult literature. This present volume is the first complete new work from the hand of Franz Bardon to appear since his famous series of books on Hermetics. Compiled from the notes of his students in Prague, it represents his oral teachings on the nature of the magical universe. Set in the form of questions and answers, this book is an invaluable addition to the Bardon material.</p><p>With permission from Divine Providence, the spirit of a highly developed Hermetic adept entered the body of a fourteen-year-old child named Franz Bardon, destined to become one of the most remarkable magicians of the 20th century. Though he maintained a "normal life" as an industrial mechanic and family man in the Czech town of Opava, his other, occult life was full of attainment, power and tragedy. During the last years of WWII, Franz Bardon spent three and a half years in a concentration camp, from which he ultimately escaped. After the war, he practiced as a naturopath and graphologist and devoted himself to the teaching of Hermeticism and the writing of his now classic works, <i>Initiation into Hermetics</i>, <i>The Practice of Magical Evocation</i>, and <i>The Key to the True Kabbalah</i>. This newly discovered work will help students of Hermetics with precise information on universal principles.Questions And Comments Concerning The Mental Plane <p>1. What Is The Will? The will is a fundamental attribute of the spirit; it is an aspect of the universal Fire element. As a quality, the will expresses itself only in the content or goal of the wish. Most of us simply make an effort and wish to attain something, but we do not possess the right power to make that wish manifest. That is why we continue to wish. The power of the will is the quantity through which we achieve, produce, carry out and maintain what we aim for and what we wish for. </p><p>2. What Is Belief? Belief is a quality. In general, its foundation is a particular belief, whether in the existence of God or of something else. The quantity of a manifested belief is a power that expresses itself in an absolute and unshakable conviction that what we believe in will positively become a reality. Belief as a power is a complement; it is the organ that bears the impulsive part of the will. The manifested belief is the highest aspect of the Akasha principle. </p><p>3. Aspects Of The Intellect And Intelligence, Memory And Discernment. The Ability To Recognize And Differentiate. Intellect or intelligence is a fundamental attribute of the eternal spirit. It is an aspect of the universal Air element on the mental plane. Intelligence or intellect can be measured and is therefore quantitative. Through it we understand, recognize, differentiate, judge and remember everything. The quality of the intellect, intelligence, is the substance (content) which the intellect works on. Generally, it has its physical seat in the chest, where the Air element is located and where it is at work. In accordance with Indian philosophy, the seat of the intellect, together with the will, is in the head, between the eyebrows, in the astral body. Memory is an aspect of the intellect. Its quality is the substance (thoughts, events, pictures, impressions, perceptions etc.) which it draws from its reserves. </p><p>4. What Are Feelings, Life And Love? Feelings, life and love are all aspects of the universal Water element as a fundamental attribute of the eternal spirit on the mental plane. Feeling is a quality that expresses itself in pleasant, unpleasant, ugly, pure and many other feelings. Its quantity, for example, is the aggregate of normal feelings which are controlled by the will, or passionate, uncontrolled, quick or very weak, hardly perceptible feelings. It expresses itself on all planes depending on the content and the power of the effect. Life is the result of the work of the elements in the tetrapolar magnet on all planes. The qualitative life reflects in a human being through polarized radiation of the elementary attributes. For the astral plane, see information on the aura (pp. 26, 32, 45). Qualitative life expresses itself in the temporary (i.e. in a particular length of time): </p><p>a. in time and space on the material plane, b. in space on the astral plane, and c. in eternity, without time and space, on the mental plane. </p><p>Life expresses itself in any type of activity or movement that can be measured. Love is a universal law. In order to be recognized by His created beings, God divided Himself on His highest level of love into a plus and a minus. This means that He divided everything created into something active and passive, positive and negative, through which an absolute, unalterable lawfulness came into existence. Love is quantity, because it can be measured. Through love we express our positive relationship for everything we like and love. True love must be controlled by the will. Passions can originate from an uncontrolled love, which means passionate love, for example sexual love, which originates from a fiery sensual love, or an abnormal love of wealth, of animals, parents, children, husband or wife. But it can also be the uncontrolled love for God Himself, as for instance among the mystics. Love controlled by the will protects us from any overwrought state, and we express our love, of whatever kind it might be, in a form that corresponds to our power and perception of what the object of our love deserves. It is of course a foregone conclusion that we love our Creator above all. That is the highest, purest and mightiest love. The quality of love as an attribute expresses itself in its rays, in its polarity and in its various kinds. </p><p>5. What Is The Instinct Of Self-Preservation? The instinct of self-preservation is the lowest aspect of the Akasha principle. It exists on every plane in accordance with circumstances and causes. Its power or quantity is that much greater the more the life of a human being is threatened, as for example in the case of fatal diseases, serious accidents, war and so on. The value of the quality of the instinct of self-preservation lies in the wish to live as long as possible on the material plane. We may assign this instinct for self-preservation to the active attributes and powers whenever the person concerned applies it for noble purposes and to the negative attributes and powers whenever a person wants to prolong his life simply for egotistical reasons. </p><p>6. What Are Self-Consciousness And The "I" Consciousness? Self-consciousness is a state in which we become conscious of who we are. This consciousness signifies that we identify ourselves in the mental sphere with the highest divine idea, with the eternal spirit that exists within us. The "I" consciousness is a fundamental attribute of the spirit on the mental plane as an aspect of the universal Earth element. It is also a mirror of our active attributes. In the thought, its qualitative part appears to us as active. The "I" consciousness contains all the fundamental attributes of the spirit, the Fire, Air and Water elements which are the will, intellect and feelings, love and life. It is effective in the entire body and as an energy; it is the quantitative part of the consciousness and is also contained in the blood. The consciousness of the cerebrum is located on the mental plane, in the mental body.</p></p><h2>Springs of Friendship</h2><p>Famous quotations about friendship from Byron, Camus, Dostoyevski, Kierkegaard and others.</p><p></p><h2>NIV, Thinline Bible, Large Print, Bonded Leather, Black, Red Letter Edition</h2><p>Color: Black Lightweight.

Derived from a wild grass called </i>teosintl, <i>corn was planted in Mexico&#x2019;s Tehuacan Valley as early as 8,000 years ago. The oldest corn found north of the border was discovered in New Mexico&#x2019;s Bat Cave. It is about 5,500 years old. The Hopi&#x2019;s say: &#x201c;Moing&#x2019;iima makes corn. Everything grows on his body. He is short, about the height of a boy. He has a female partner. Every summer he becomes heavy, his body is full of vegetables: watermelon, corn, squash. They grow in his body. When the Hopi plant, they invariably ask him to make the crop flourish; then their things come up, whether vegetables or fruit. When he shaves his body, the seeds come out, and afterward his body is thin. He used to live on this earth and go with the Hopi. When things grow ripe, he becomes thin and is unhappy. He stays in the West.&#x201d; Corn had equal significance for tribes in the East, as we see in this tale from a New England tribe.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br>***<br>&nbsp;<br>When Kloskurbeh, the All-maker, lived on earth, there were no people yet. But one day when the sun was high, a youth appeared and called him &#x201c;Uncle, brother of my mother.&#x201d; This young man was born from the foam of the waves, foam quickened by the wind and warmed by the sun. It was the motion of the wind, the moistness of water, and the sun&#x2019;s warmth which gave him life&#x2014;warmth above all, because warmth is life. And the young man lived with Kloskurbeh and became his chief helper.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, after these two powerful being had created all manner of things, there came to them, as the sun was shining at high noon, a beautiful girl. She was born of the wonderful earth plant, and of the dew, and of warmth. Because a drop of dew full on a leaf and was warmed by the sun, and the warming sun is life, this girl came into being&#x2014;from the green living plant, from moisture, and from warmth.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I am love, said the maiden. &#x201c;I am a strength giver, I am the nourisher, I am the provider of men and animals. They all love me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then Kloskurbeh thanked the Great Mystery Above for having sent them the maiden. The youth, the Great Nephew, married her, and the girl conceived and thus became the First Mother. And Kloskurbeh, the Great Uncle, who teaches humans all they need to know, taught their children how to live. Then he went away to dwell in the north, from which he will return sometime when he is needed.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now the people increased and became numerous. They lived by hunting, and the more people there were, the less game they found. They were hunting it out, and as the animals decreased, starvation came upon the people. And the First Mother pitied them.<br>&nbsp;<br>The little children came to First Mother and said: &#x201c;We are hungry. Feed us.&#x201d; But she had nothing to give them, and she wept. She told them: &#x201c;Be patient. I will make some food. Then your little bellies will be full.&#x201d; But she kept weeping.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her husband asked: &#x201c;How can I make you smile? How can I make you happy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;There is only one thing that will stop my tears.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; asked her husband.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It is this: you must kill me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I could never do that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You must, or I will go on weeping and grieving forever.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Then the husband traveled far, to the end of the earth, to the north he went, to ask the Great Instructor, his uncle Kloskurbeh, what he should do.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You must do what she wants. You must kill her,&#x201d; said Kloskurbeh. Then the young man went back to his home, and it was his turn to weep. But First Mother said: &#x201c;Tomorrow at high noon you must do it. After you have killed me, let two of our sons take hold of my hair and drag my body over that empty patch of earth. Let them drag my back and forth, back and forth, over every part of that patch, until all of my flesh has been torn from my body. Afterward, take my bones, gather them up, and bury them in the middle of this clearing. Then leave that place.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>She smiled and said, &#x201c;Wait seven moons and then come back, and you will find my flesh there, flesh given out of love, and it will nourish and strengthen you forever and ever.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>So it was done. The husband slew the wife and her sons, praying, dragged her body to and fro as she had commanded, until her flesh covered all the earth. Then they took up her cones and buried them in the middle of it. Weeping loudly, they went away.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the husband and his children and his children&#x2019;s children came back to that place after seven moons had passed, they found the earth covered will tall, green, tasseled plants. The plants&#x2019; fruit&#x2014;corn&#x2014;was First Mother&#x2019;s flesh, given so that the people might live and flourish/ And the partook of First Mother&#x2019;s flesh and found it sweet beyond words. Following her instructions, they did not eat all, but put many kernels back into the earth. In this way her flesh and spirit renewed themselves every seven months, generation after generation.<br>&nbsp;<br>And at the spot where they had burned First Mother&#x2019;s ones, there grew another plant, broad-leafed and fragrant. It was First Mother&#x2019;s breath, and they heard her spirit talking: &#x201c;Burn this up and smoke it. It is sacred. It will clear your minds, help your prayers, and gladden your hearts.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>And First Mother&#x2019;s husband called the first plant <i>Skarmunal, </i>corn, and the second plant <i>utarmur-wayeh, </i>tobacco.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Remember,&#x201d; he told the people,&#x201d; and take good care of First Mother&#x2019;s flesh, because it is her goodness become substance. Take good care of her breath, because it is her love turned into smoke. Remember her and think of her whenever you eat, whenever you smoke this sacred plant, because she has given her life so that you might live. Yet she is not dead, she lives: in undying love she renews herself again and again.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2014;<i>Retold from three nineteenth-century sources, including Joseph Nicolar.</i></p><h2>The River&#39;s Tale: A Year on the Mekong</h2><p><i>The River&#x2019;s Tale</i> is a deeply informed personal chronicle of a remarkable journey down the Mekong River as it runs through China, Tibet, Burma, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam. In it Edward A. Gargan tells a stirring tale of adventure that reveals the Mekong&#x2019;s many worlds.<br><br>Beginning in 1998, Gargan was at last able to pursue his long-held dream of traveling the three thousand miles of the river and lingering where he wished. He was, in a sense, coming to terms with places and peoples with which he had already linked his life. His youthful opposition to the Vietnam War had been the first manifestation of his passionate interest in Asia, where he subsequently spent much of his career as a <i>New York Times</i> correspondent.<br><br>His travels show us a kind of modernity settling uneasily on regions still mired in backwardness and poverty, and shadows that linger so many years after the end of the Vietnam War. We visit Internet caf�s in dirt-streeted towns near thatched-hut villages without electricity. The magnificent Angkor Wat, a hub of tourism, is surrounded by the ruins engendered by Pol Pot&#x2019;s genocidal reign. We see plodding mule trains caravanning sacks of opium through Burma on their way to China to be processed and distributed to the West. Tibetan horsemen adorned in silver and amber jewelry herd yaks across endless grasslands as their ancestors did, though their culture is under siege by the Chinese. Vietnamese salesmen scooter around Saigon hawking American soaps, passing by outcast children fathered by American soldiers and left behind. Buddhism flowers in a Laos ravaged by communism. Sex tourism thrives in prosperous Thailand, a trade chiefly involving teenagers, who pay a deadly price.<br><br>And throughout, there is the Mekong&#x2014;shaping landscapes, linking cultures, sustaining populations, showcasing spectacular beauty. Edward Gargan is an acutely observant, sympathetic guide to a fascinating world, and he has written a powerful and lyrical book.</p><p>"The Mekong scours some of the saddest history of recent years," writes Edward A. Gargan in this richly described and melancholic tale of his journey through Tibet, China, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Thirty years after landing in jail for refusing to register for the draft, the war-protester-turned-foreign-correspondent decided to see for himself how these countries have brought themselves back from the brink, and how their myriad cultures are struggling to preserve themselves. Beginning at the source of the Mekong River, near a camp of nomads high on the Tibetan plateau, he followed the 3,000 mile-long waterway through the heart of some of Asia's most complex and wounded societies. While the first half of Gargan's story, which focuses on China's demolition of Tibetan and other minority cultures, is interesting, it becomes gripping in the claustrophobic paranoia of Laos and post-Pol Pot Cambodia. Ultimately it becomes clear that while America lost the war in Vietnam, it has never left the region--lingering in the scars of war and inversely the creeping acceptance, if not embrace, of all things American. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>"For all his lyric descriptions of the great river and its moods, Mr. Gargan has written far more than a picturesque personal travel diary. He offers an insider's look infused with sympathy and often with anguish at the political and societal tragedies he meets on the way....Not many Americans would attempt the trek of this huge river, from sources to delta....Still fewer would possess the knowledge, the imagination, the wit and the deep-rooted sympathy with Asian peoples that characterize Mr. Gargan's writing. He tells a unique and thought-provoking story."<br>--Frank Gibney, <i>New York Times</i><br>"<i>The River's Tale </i>is an engrossing discovery of the lands and peoples along a river that has stirred the imagination of wanderers and adventurers for as long as I can remember."<br>--David Lamb, author of <i>The Arabs</i><br>"This is a great journey Ed Gargan takes us on, weaving down the deep river through seven countries, encountering tea, elephants, monks, Kublai Khan, dolphins, ferries, and things inexplicably horrible, and beautiful, all along the way. <i>The River's Tale </i>is a lyrical, clear-sighted account of the ancient, roiling soul of the Mekong."<br>--David Maraniss, author of <i>When Pride Still Mattered<br></i>&#x201c;<i>The River&#x2019;s Tale</i> guides us through a river of strange and untamed scents and<br>sensibilities, taking us through the battles of peoples who for centuries have tied their lives to the relentlessly flowing lifeblood of the Mekong.

Scarcely less remarkable is his explanation of how conifers, with only 627 species, grew to occupy every continent on earth ranging from the high latitudes to the tropics. This illuminating review will fascinate plant lovers who wish to discover the extraordinary relatives of ordinary garden conifers, natural historians, who will relish seeing conifers reviewed in a broad context, and all who seek to learn more about the early history of life on our planet.</p>Aljos Farjon headed the temperate section of the herbarium at the Royal Botanic gardens, Kew 1996&#x2013;2006. He has published 10 books and more than 120 papers mainly, but not exclusively, on conifers. He is a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, Chair of the Conifer Specialist Group of IUCN (the World Conservation Union) and a member of both the International Association for Plant Taxonomy and the Royal Horticultural Society&#x2019;s Conifer Registration Advisory Committee.</p><h2>The General: MacArthur and the Man He Called &#34;Doc&#34;</h2><p>Insightful look into The General</p><p></p><h2>Black Mountain: An Exploration In Community</h2><p>Reprint of the E.P.

Neither a &#34;how to drive a race car&#34; manual, nor a recounting of &#34;my greatest races&#34; Stewart&#39;s book is about what it takes to succeed as a race driver, about his philosophy, about preparation and discipline as the basis for success.

In particular, The Backwoods of Canada, first published in 1836, details the everyday life of Canada s founding communities. Together with her sister, Susannah Moodie (who penned the equally historically significant Roughing it in the Bush), Traill became an important resource for settlers arriving in Canada during the nineteenth century. Continuing to write and publish well into her nineties, Catherine Parr Traill is celebrated as one of the first authors in Canadian literary history. She died in 1899 at the age of 97.</p><b>Letter I</b><br>&nbsp;<br>Departure from Greenock in the Brig <i>Laurel</i>. &#x2013; Fitting-up of the Vessel. &#x2013; Boy Passenger. &#x2013; Sea Prospect. &#x2013; Want of Occupation and Amusement. &#x2013; Captain&#x2019;s Goldfi nch.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Brig </i>Laurel<i>, July 18, 1832.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>I received your last kind letter, my dearest mother, only a few hours before we set sail from Greenock. As you express a wish that I should give you a minute detail of our voyage, I shall take up my subject from the time of our embarkation, and write as inclination prompts me. Instead of having reason to complain of short letters, you will, I fear, fi nd mine only too prolix.<br>&nbsp;<br>After many delays and disappointments, we succeeded at last in obtaining a passage in a fast-sailing brig, the <i>Laurel</i>, of Greenock; and favourable winds are now rapidly carrying us across the Atlantic.<br>&nbsp;<br>The <i>Laurel </i>is not a regular passenger-ship, which I consider an advantage, for what we lose in amusement and variety we assuredly gain in comfort. The cabin is neatly fi tted up, and I enjoy the luxury (for such it is, compared with the narrow berths of the state cabin) of a handsome sofa, with crimson draperies, in the great cabin. The state cabin is also ours. We paid fi fteen pounds each for our passage to Montreal. This was high, but it includes every expense; and, in fact, we had no choice. The only vessel in the river bound for Canada, was a passenger-ship literally swarming with emigrants, chiefl y of the lower class of Highlanders.<br>&nbsp;<br>The only passengers besides ourselves in the <i>Laurel </i>are the captain&#x2019;s nephew, a pretty yellow-haired lad, about fi fteen years of age, who works his passage out, and a young gentleman who is going out as clerk in a merchant&#x2019;s house in Quebec. He seems too much wrapped up in his own affairs to be very communicative to others; he walks much, talks little, and reads less; but often amuses himself by singing as he paces the deck, &#x201c;Home, sweet home,&#x201d; and that delightful song by Camoens, &#x201c;Isle of beauty.&#x201d; It is a sweet song, and I can easily imagine the charm it has for a home-sick heart.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was much pleased with the scenery of the Clyde; the day we set sail was a lovely one, and I remained on deck till nightfall. The morning light found our vessel dashing gallantly along, with a favourable breeze, through the north channel; that day we saw the last of the Hebrides, and before night lost sight of the north coast of Ireland. A wide expanse of water and sky is now our only prospect, unvaried by any object save the distant and scarcely to be traced outline of some vessel just seen at the verge of the horizon, a speck in the immensity of space, or sometimes a few sea-fowl. I love to watch these wanderers of the ocean, as they rise and fall with the rocking billows, or fl it about our vessel; and often I wonder whence they came, to what distant shore they are bound, and if they make the rude wave their home and resting-place during the long day and dark night; and then I recall to mind the words of the American poet, Bryant, &#x2013;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He who from zone to zone<br>Guides through the boundless air their certain fl ight,<br>In the long way that I must tread alone<br>Will guide my steps aright.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Though we have been little more than a week on board, I am getting weary of the voyage. I can only compare the monotony of it to being weather-bound in some country inn. I have already made myself acquainted with all the books worth reading in the ship&#x2019;s library; unfortunately, it is chiefl y made up with old novels and musty romances.<br>&nbsp;<br>When the weather is fi ne I sit on a bench on the deck, wrapped in my cloak, and sew, or pace the deck with my husband, and talk over plans for the future, which in all probability will never be realized. I really do pity men who are not actively employed: women have always their needle as a resource against the overwhelming weariness of an idle life; but where a man is confi ned to a small space, such as the deck and cabin of a trading vessel, with nothing to see, nothing to hear, nothing to do, and nothing to read, he is really a very pitiable creature.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is one passenger on board that seems perfectly happy, if one may judge from the liveliness of the songs with which he greets us whenever we approach his cage. It is &#x201c;Harry,&#x201d; the captain&#x2019;s goldfi nch &#x2013; &#x201c;the <i>captain&#x2019;s mate</i>,&#x201d; as the sailors term him. This pretty creature has made no fewer than twelve voyages in the <i>Laurel</i>. &#x201c;It is all one to him whether his cage is at sea or on land, he is still at home,&#x201d; said the captain, regarding his little favourite with an air of great affection, and evidently gratifi ed by the attention I bestowed on his bird.<br>&nbsp;<br>I have already formed a friendship with the little captive. He never fails to greet my approach with one of his sweetest songs, and will take from my fi ngers a bit of biscuit, which he holds in his claws till he has thanked me with a few of his clearest notes. This mark of acknowledg ment is termed by the steward, &#x201c;saying grace.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>If the wind still continues to favour us, the captain tells us we shall be on the banks of Newfoundland in another week. Farewell for the present.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Friend</h2><p>From the beloved husband-and-wife team of <i>The Gardener</i>, a Caldecott Honor Book<br><br><i>Annabelle Bernadette Clementine Dodd</i><br><i>Was a good little girl, though decidedly odd.</i><br><i>Belle lived every day as if she were grown --</i><br><i>She thought she could do everything all on her own.</i><br><br>Lucky for Belle, she has a friend at home, a caregiver named Beatrice Smith -- Bea -- who keeps a close eye on her so she doesn't get into too much mischief. Through the week Belle helps Bea as she does chores or shops or bakes, and at the end of most days they head to the beach -- Belle and Bea, hand in hand, by the sea. But one afternoon Belle sneaks outside to play all alone, and something happens that changes her life forever. <br><br>A lyrical rhymed text and pictures that pack emotion combine to present powerful portraits of a girl and her loving guardian.<br></p><p>Husband and wife duo Sarah Stewart and David Small have worked together on several picture books, including <i>The Gardener</i>, a Caldecott Honor book available from Square Fish. Small has also illustrated other books, including the 2001 Caldecott Medal winner <i>So You Want to Be President?</i>, by Judith St. George. Stewart and Small live in a historic home on a bend of the St. Joseph River in Michigan.This book appreciates the caretakers in the world--those like Bea, friend and companion who watches over little Belle. In fact, Stewart dedicates this book to "all the people across the world who have saved the lives of children by paying attention when others did not." Here Stewart's meaning is quite literal--little Belle runs out to the ocean alone and has a scary encounter. Stewart's voice hints of the South as she reads her lightly rhyming prose. Musical expressions illustrate the contentment of a lazy day by the ocean and the terror of being grabbed by a large wave. Children will enjoy David Small's award-winning illustrations as they follow along with Stewart's calm, well-paced reading.

Meadows, Dennis L. Meadows, Jorgen Randers, William W. Behrens III The message of this book is urgent and sobering: The earth&#39;s interlocking resources- the global system of nature in which we all live- probably cannot support present rates of economic and population growth much beyond the year 2100, if that long, even with advanced technology. In the summer of 1970, an international team of researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology began a study of the implications of continued worldwide growth. They examined the five basic facts that determine and, in their interactions, ultimately limit growth on this planet- population increase, agricultural production, nonrenewable resource depletion, industrial output, and pollution generation. The MIT team fed data on these five factors into a global computer model and then tested the behavior of the model under several sets of assumptions to determine alternative patters for mankind&#39;s future. THE LIMITS TO GROWTH is the non-technical report of their findings. The book contains a message of hope, as well: Man can create a society in which he can live indefinitely on earth if he imposes limits on himself and his productions of material goods to achieve a state of global equilibrium with population and production in carefully selected balance. &#34;This book raises life-and-death questions that confront mankind as it strives for achievement of a prosperous and equitable society.&#34; ---Vernon E.

This book is based partly on a river that flowed past her garden, and partly on rivers she has seen on her travels in many other parts of the world. Bee Wiley has created artwork for books, magazines, even CD covers. With this book, she says, the flow of the river (starting as a trickle, then gaining speed and collecting things on its way to the sea) is like the flow of teamwork that went into making River Story.A luscious blend of cool blues and verdant greens lights up the pages of this poetic picture book, which traces the course of a river from its source in the mountains to the sea. Hooper's (The Pebble in My Pocket) lyrical use of language emulates the rhythms of the river. Beginning with the languid, soothing sounds of alliteration ("a small shining stream slipping over pebbles"), the narrative picks up the pace as the river gains momentum at a waterfall ("snowfalls of water,/ springfuls of water,/ streamfuls of water"), then quiets down as it leaves the mountains ("It winds between meadows, long strands of waterweed streaking its surface") before its final arrival where "waves wash sand, and fresh water meets salt water." Willey (The Golden Hoard) adds a good measure of child appeal. For a spread that allows readers to peek beneath the water's surface, "little fish darting, bottles dropped, treasures lost," she shows a beloved toy airplane beached on the river bottom. Her palette and line seem especially suited for these riverside views, from the slender reeds of a cattail to a sandpiper's beak to the water itself, as it gushes and crashes, ripples and flows downriver.

This exhibition was a unique interdisciplinary exploration of art and culture in the late nineteenth century and the late twentieth century involving the depiction or suggestion of ghosts. This major exhibition examines the social and cultural circumstances in which ghosts entered public discourse while considering as well the manner and media through which the ghostly has been rendered in images. The Disembodied Spirit observes how artists have represented absence while still indicating presence-using formal elements such as transparency, light, shadows, and weightlessness-and their manipulation, alteration, and exaggeration of these characteristics. The exhibition and accompanying catalogue essays examine cultural phenomena, such as Spiritualism in the late nineteenth century, as well as the contemporary fixation with cyberspace, virtual reality, and the less techno-hip phenomenon of angels. Included are works by nineteenth-century photographers such as William Mumler, Georgiana Houghton, Julia Margaret Cameron and contemporary artists such as Jeremy Blake, Nancy Burson, Gregory Crewdson, Anna Gaskell, Ann Hamilton, Glenn Ligon, Tracey Moffatt, Mariko Mori, and Bill Viola.</p><p></p><h2>The Pruning Specialist: The Essential Guide to Caring for Shrubs, Trees, Climbers, Hedges, Conifers, Roses and Fruit Trees (Specialist Series)</h2><p>Beautifully illustrated and encyclopedic in scope, this is the only guide you&#x2019;ll ever need to become a pruning expert.

These were Canada&#x2019;s formative years, when she resembled an adolescent, grappling with the problems of puberty, often at odds with her parents, craving to be treated as an adult, hungry for the acclaim of her peers, and wary of the dominating presence of a more sophisticated neighbour.&#x201d; &#x2013;</i> From the Introduction <br><br>Canada's twentieth century can be divided roughly into two halves. All the wars and all the unnecessary battles in which Canadian youth was squandered belong to the first &#x2014; from the autumn of 1899 to the summer of 1953. From the mid-1950s on, Canada has concerned itself not with war but with peace.<br><br>The first war of the century, which took Canadian soldiers to South Africa, and the last, which sent them to Korea, bracket the bookends on the shelf of history. They have a good deal in common with, these two minor conflicts, whose chronicles pale when compared to the bloodbaths of the two world wars.<br><br>Canada's wartime days are long past, and for many, the scars of war have healed. Vimy has been manicured clean, its pockmarked slopes softened by a green mantle of Canadian pines. Dieppe has reverted to a resort town, its beaches long since washed free of Canadian blood. Nowadays, Canadians are proud of their role as Peacekeepers, from which they have gained a modicum of international acclaim the nation has always craved, with precious little blood wasted in the process.<br><br>In this monumental work, Pierre Berton brings Canadian history to life once again, relying on a host of sources, including newspaper accounts and first-hand reports, to tell the story of these four wars through the eyes of the privates in the trenches, the generals at the front, and the politicians and families back home. By profiling the interwar years, Berton traces how one war led to the next, and how the country was changed in the process. Illustrated with maps and line drawings, Marching as to War describes how the experience of war helped to bind Canada together as a nation and chronicles the transformation of Canada's dependence upon Great Britain and its slow emergence as an independent nation caught in a love-hate relationship with the United States.</p><p>&#x201c;Pierre Berton entertained me royally. . . .

Among these cherished belongings was his copy of Tsong-kha-pa&#x2019;s classic text <i>The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment</i>. This text distills all of the essential points of Tibetan Buddhism, clearly unfolding the entire Buddhist path to enlightenment. <br><br>In 2008, celebrating the long-awaited completion of the English-language translation of <i>The Great Treatise</i>, the Dalai Lama gave a historic six-day teaching at Lehigh University to explain the meaning of this classic text and to underscore its importance. It is the longest teaching that he has ever given to Westerners on just one text, and Westerners have never before had the opportunity to receive such a complete teaching that encompasses the totality of the Buddhist path from the Dalai Lama.<i> From Here to Enlightenment</i> makes the teachings from this momentous event available for a wider audience.</p><p>His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is considered the foremost Buddhist leader of our time. The exiled spiritual head of the Tibetan people, he is a Nobel Peace Laureate, a Congressional Gold Medal recipient, and a remarkable teacher and scholar who has authored over one hundred books.<b>Chapter One </b><br><b>&nbsp;Deep Connections </b><br>Good afternoon, everybody. Indeed I am very, very happy to be here to lecture on the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment (lam rim chen mo).1 I visited the late Geshe Wangyal&#x2019;s center during my first visit to America in 1979 because, especially since the time of the Third Dalai Lama, there have long been very close links between Tibetans and Mongolians.2 Tibetans have a unique and very close relationship with Mongolians, including the Kalmyks and Buryats. In my own case, one of my best study partners was Ngodrup Tsokyi, a Mongolian. He helped me so much, so I feel a very close, personal connection. One time when I visited the late Geshe Wangyal&#x2019;s center, we reflected on the many stories of our strong connections in the past. Everyone was deeply moved and we were all in tears together. <br>Joshua Cutler, Director of the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center, is neither Tibetan nor Mongolian; he is European American. But I do think Joshua and Diana have very faithfully carried on the late Geshe Wangyal&#x2019;s spirit. They asked me to teach the Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment and they translated it into English. I promised that in the future I would teach this text. Today, that is realized. <br>But of course this book is quite thick. Reading it all in a few days is impossible. So I will teach primarily by summarizing its essential points, elaborating as necessary. <br>The Great Treatise was written by Lama Tsong-kha-pa, a great scholar, a real holder of the Nalanda tradition.3 I think he is one of the very best Tibetan scholars. Although it is now widely available in Tibetan as well as English, you see that I brought with me today my own personal copy of this text. On March 17th, 1959, when I left Norbulingka that night, I brought this book with me.4 Since then, I have used it ten or fifteen times to give teachings, all from this copy. So this is something very dear to me. <br><b>Global Responsibility </b><br>Most of you are familiar with my commitments, my views and thoughts. But perhaps some of you are new, so I want to mention briefly my basic commitments. In the first place, I am just one human being among six billion. The fact is that all six billion human beings share one planet. We all survive under one sun. Today, especially, we are simply one community in the face of population growth, instantaneous communication, the modern global economy, and our common environmental problems. We are really one entity. In reality, there is no separate, independent, individual interest. For each of us, the future is entirely dependent on the rest of humanity, the rest of the world. But our ways of thinking about things are still based on concepts inherited from ancient times when each community lived more or less independently. There is a growing gap between our perceptions and reality. Our outdated way of thinking gives us the mistaken view that we&#x2013;&#x2013;and our communities&#x2013;&#x2013; are separate from the rest of the world. Based on that, our actions are unrealistic. <br>Nobody wants more problems. Nonetheless, there are many problems and many of them we create for ourselves because we lack a holistic, realistic view. In order to develop a sense of global responsibility, we have to look at the entire planet. It is just one small planet and our individual futures entirely depend upon it. We must take care of it. The only way to safeguard our futures as individuals is to develop a sense of concern for the well-being of all other people, all of the other living beings in the world. <br>So my primary commitment is to make it clear that we need a sense of global responsibility. In this regard, I consider Buddhist teachings not as a religion, but simply as some ideas that may be helpful. It is useful, for example, to consider all living beings. Maybe it seems unrealistic to think about other beings in other worlds. Whether you think it makes sense or not, emotionally it is very useful. When we have been practicing extending our concern to an infinite number of beings on an infinite number of planets, then of course there is no question that we would want to care for six billion human beings right here on this planet. And billions of animals&#x2014;they really suffer immensely at human hands, don&#x2019;t they? So the Buddhist message of infinite altruism is very relevant. It is not about our future lifetimes or becoming enlightened. It is simply that infinite altruism is very useful for becoming a happier person, a sensible and useful person on this planet.5 <br>In day-to-day life, whenever we are facing difficulty, some of these Buddhist ideas can be really helpful. They equip our minds, particularly our emotions, so that we can maintain peace of mind when we are facing difficulty. This is good for our health. Too many worries and too much ambition are bound to increase suspicion and jealousy, leading to even more mental disturbance. Some of these Buddhist ideas can be very helpful to the well-being of individuals, mentally and emotionally. And in dependence upon that, they have physical benefits as well. So if you are a nonbeliever who has no interest in religion, fine. Listen to some of these ideas and if you hear something that seems useful, then take it. If you it feel that is nonsense, then just forget it. <br><b>Religious Harmony </b><br>My second commitment is to promote religious harmony. I am a Buddhist; sometimes I am considered a staunch Buddhist. Those ancient Indian Buddhist masters, particularly the scholars of Nalanda University, had very, very critical minds. 6 They analyzed everything, both the Buddha&#x2019;s own words and the views of non-Buddhist traditions. Buddhist masters like Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Dignaga, Dharmakirti, and Shantarakshita were very sharp logicians who were able to find every crack, every weakness, in non-Buddhist philosophical positions. I am like this, at least to some degree. I want to investigate, to analyze, and in that sense I can say that I am a very staunch Buddhist. <br>At the same time, I also accept the value or potential of all of the major traditions. It is so terrible, so sad, that there is conflict in the name of religion. Innocent, genuine, faithful people suffer as a result. So it is essential to make an effort to promote religious harmony within a sense of respect and mutual understanding. It helps for non-Buddhists to understand something about the structure of Buddhism and for Buddhists to understand other religions. <br>This is why, yesterday, I went on pilgrimage in Rajasthan to the Ajmer Sharif shrine, a famous Muslim holy place.7 It is perhaps the holiest place of Sufi Islam. Each year, prayers are offered for six days to commemorate the death of a great saint. They invited me. They prayed all night, but I preferred to participate in the early morning. So yesterday from 2:30 to 4:30 A.M. I prayed while wearing a Muslim hat&#x2014;a Buddhist monk&#x2019;s robe and a Muslim hat.8 There seemed to be several hundred thousand people and it was incredibly hot and humid. Of course, with so many people packed in a small area, there was sweat and odor. Maybe we can call it the scent of ethical discipline&#x2014;mixed, of course, with sweat! My robes are still damp right now. I really enjoyed this; it was wonderful. <br>A few weeks earlier there was an international Muslim conference in Delhi. They invited me and I think I was the only non-Muslim participating. That afternoon, I visited the Jamma Masjid in Delhi and prayed together with thousands and thousands of Muslims.9 That was the first time I wore the Muslim white cap. Personally, this made me very happy, conservative elements might feel differently about my doing this. But the response from the mainstream community was excellent. It seems that people appreciated my efforts to promote inter-religious harmony and genuine respect across the traditions. <br>If you also think that this issue of understanding and harmony across the world religions is important, then please take action. Make closer contacts with the followers of other traditions. Since the September 11th event, it is extremely important to reach out to Muslim brothers and sisters, to make contact with them. Many people have a negative impression of Muslims and that is totally wrong. <br>Of course, in the past, many Indian Buddhists did suffer a great deal at the hands of Muslims, but the past is gone.10 It is useless to dwell on this and to hold on to hatred. It is absolutely foolish. Today, for example, there are many Muslims living in the Bodhgaya area. I think that perhaps their ancestors came to Bodhgaya in order to destroy the Buddhist temple there.11 But now they are the best friends of Buddhist pilgrims. Whenever I visit Bodhgaya they welcome me with tea and some very delicious nuts. I always enjoy that. That is the reality today. <br><b>China and Tibet </b><br>My third commitment is to the cause of Tibet and its people and cul&#xffad;&#xffad;ans and Chinese, it&#x2019;s my moral responsibility to speak for Tibetans. Unfortunately, since the crisis of March 10, 2008, Chinese government propaganda has given many Chinese the sense that Tibetans are anti�Chinese.12 Feelings were running high. During my last visit to America, some Chinese were demonstrating where I was speaking, so I wanted to meet some of them. I did meet seven of them. Two of them calmly listened to my explanations, but the rest were very angry and had no interest in listening. The emotions involved are just too strong. <br>I suggested that now is a perfect time to set up friendship groups communities. They should get to know each other so that when a problem arises, they can discuss it, exchanging information and perspective. Without this, there is usually no communication between these groups. They remain isolated and then, when there is an incident, emotions overwhelm them. <br>You can help. In any community where there are some Tibetans and some Han Chinese, help them to create a common friendship group. You can join as well, as long as you have some sincere motivation. But in the end, the Tibetan problem has to be solved between the Han Chinese and the Tibetans. No one else can do this for us. <br>We Tibetans extend our right hand to our Han Chinese friends and our left hand to our Western supporters. Of the two hands, the right hand is considered more important. We extend this hand to the Chinese government. But as long as this right hand remains empty, our left hand accepts help from other people who are really concerned for us. It is only logical and natural. When the right hand gets some concrete result, then the left hand will withdraw and wave goodbye. <br>It is extremely important that our Han Chinese brothers and sisters have full awareness of the Tibetan problem. It is helpful to take every opportunity to tell them about Tibetan culture, Tibetan language, or Tibetan spirituality. Then there will be a chance to say something about history, considering Tibetan views and Chinese views. Among the Chinese, there are different views about history; not everyone accepts the official version. We need a realistic approach and in order to have that, we need fuller knowledge about reality. Maybe some of you can help in this way. <br><b>Junior Students in the Dharma </b><br>According to the conventional understanding of history, the Buddha came to the world almost twenty-six hundred years ago. Eventually the teachings of the Buddha spread from India to different regions, including Southeast Asia and East Asia. Today, Burma, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, and so forth mainly follow the Pali tradition. In China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam&#x2014;as well as Tibet and Mongolia&#x2014;the Pali tradition is present, but there is also the Sanskrit tradition.13 For understanding Buddhism in the Sanskrit tradition, Chinese language is most important, followed by Tibetan. Buddhism flourished in China at least three or four centuries earlier than in Tibet. <br>I consider the Pali tradition to be the most senior; it is the foundation of the Buddha Dharma. Those who hold this tradition are the most senior students of the Buddha. Then, within the Sanskrit tradition, the Chinese Buddhists are the most senior Buddhists. We, the Tibetans and Mongolians, rank after that. So, whenever I give a teaching to the Chinese community, I always begin by expressing my respect to them as elder students of the Buddha. <br>At the same time, I might mention that as far as knowledge is concerned, junior students are sometimes better. Tibetan Buddhism was established by Shantarakshita, one of the very best logicians and philosophers of the Nalanda tradition. He personally came to Tibet. He and his student Kamalashila were both great scholars and their writings are still available. They were great logicians, Madhyamika philosophers and monks; naturally they wanted their students, the Tibetans, also to be like that. Even now, in the twenty-first century, we study important texts in a rigorous way. First, we memorize them and then get a word-by-word explanation. After that, we debate their meaning in a thorough and highly precise way. Tibetans in general have knowledge of the Buddha Dharma simply because of these great teachers; through them, we became real holders of the Nalanda tradition. So, in terms of having a deeper and more complete form of the teaching, I do think the Tibetan tradition is the best. <br>Between texts written by Indian masters and texts written by Tibetan masters, different circumstances led to different styles. India was not just Buddhist; there were many non-Buddhists and there were extensive discussions among the best scholars of the different traditions. So Indian masters like Nagarjuna and Aryadeva wrote texts that take a more comparative perspective and engage in deeper analysis. The Tibetan masters, on the other hand, took for granted that their audience was entirely Buddhist, so they do little comparison. <br><b>Reality Is neither Buddhist nor Christian </b><br>On this planet there are many different religious traditions; each started in a different area and each is suitable to the peoples of that region.<br>For more than one thousand years, and in some cases for more than two thousand years, these traditions have truly served humanity. Today, many millions of people get inspiration from these traditions. It is a fact. And in the future these major traditions will remain, serving humanity. <br>Sometimes in the past, the existence of many different religious traditions caused problems. From now on, I hope we will have fewer such problems because of a greater sense of closeness. We understand more about the value of other traditions. Just as there are many different kinds of people, there are different traditions that suit them. Generally speaking, in the West, Christianity is dominant; the culture has a Jewish and Christian heritage. It is often safer and better to keep to your own religious tradition. <br>To illustrate this, let me relate some things that I have personally observed. There was a Polish woman who was a Theosophist&#x2014;I met her long ago at the Madras Theosophical Society.14 After 1959, when a great many Tibetans came to India, she became very close with Tibetans and she helped many young Tibetan students with their education. As a result of this connection, she came to accept Buddhism as her own religion. But later, when she was more than eighty years old and approaching death, the conce...</p><h2>A 31-Day Guide to Prayer</h2><p>From the famed South African theologian Andrew Murray, a well-known authority on the deeper Christian life, comes this practical month-long guide to better prayer.

George is a TV producer for the upstart network MBC, launching a truly and weirdly groundbreaking new show that blurs the line between fact and fiction. Lizzie is a software entrepreneur dealing with the breakneck pleasures and pains of running her own company in an industry where the rules are rewritten daily. Rocketing between Los An-geles and Seattle, with occasional stopovers at home in Manhattan for tag-team parenting of their three children, George and Lizzie are the kind of businesspeople who, growing up in the sixties and seventies, never dreamed they would end up in business. They're too busy to spend the money that's rolling in, and too smart not to feel ambivalent about their crazed, high-gloss existences, but nothing seems to slow the roller-coaster momentum of their inter-secting lives and careers. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>However, after Lizzie, recovering from a Microsoft deal gone awry, becomes a confidante and adviser to George's boss, billionaire media mogul Harold Mose, the couple discovers that no amount of sophisticated spin can obscure basic instincts: envy, greed, suspicion, sexual temptation--and, maybe, love. When they and their children are finally drawn into a thrilling, high-tech corporate hoax that sends Wall Street reeling (and makes one person very, very rich), George and Lizzie can only marvel at life's oversized surprises and hold on for dear life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Like Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities, Kurt Andersen's <b>Turn of the Century</b> lays bare the follies of our age with laser-beam precision, creating memorable characters and dissecting the ways we think, speak, and navigate this new era of extreme capitalism and mind-boggling technology. Entertaining, imaginative, knowing, and wise, <b>Turn of the Century</b> is a richly plotted comedy of manners about the way we live now.</p><p>Everyone will compare Kurt Andersen's scathingly funny first novel to Tom Wolfe's fictional debut, <i>The Bonfire of the Vanities</i>. Like Wolfe, Andersen is a merry terrorist, a status-attuned assassin with liquid nitrogen in his veins, a prose style with the cool purr of an Uzi, and the entire society in his crosshairs. And like the Man in White's protagonist, Sherman McCoy, Andersen's George Mactier is a master of the contemporary universe--not just Manhattan, but decadent post fin-de-si�cle Hollywood, the globe-gobbling, infotainment-tainted news media, and cyberspace from Seattle to Silicon Valley to Silicon Alley. <p> <i>Turn of the Century</i> opens in February 2000, in a bizarro world with just a tangy twist of futuristic extrapolation. George has parlayed a <i>Newsweek</i> writing job into a PBS documentary into a $16,575-a-week job as a producer at the sinister MBC network. His series, <i>NARCS</i>, is a veritable Cuisinart of fact and fiction in which the actors get to participate in real drug busts <i>and</i> get all the best lines, since they're working from scripts. In the most notorious episode, the dealer they arrest turns out to be an Actors Equity member (thanks to <i>Rent</i>), so he gets union scale and a recurring role. </p><p> As George stumbles into a Wolfesque calamity spiral, his wife, Lizzie Zimbalist, ascends to power. Lizzie is a brilliant software entrepreneur: her "force-feedback technology" alternative-history game can sense players' fear. "If you travel to 1792 Paris, for instance, you are designated a besotted peasant or a frightened aristocrat or an angry sansculotte according to your heart rate, blood pressure, and skin conductance; too many twitches, the wrong sort of palpitation, and you're a marquess (or marchioness) headed for the guillotine." Needless to say, her insights into the year 2000 earn her bigtime interest from George's boss and Microsoft. Lizzie is a character at least as vivid as George, and their hectic family life is uncloying and acutely observed.</p><p> Andersen's plot (involving Bill Gates's potential death) has more hairy turns than the Hana Highway--read carefully or you'll go off the road. But you're guaranteed a wild ride with amazing characters: an irreverent investor inspired by James Cramer, a hilarious MBC toady, Timothy Featherstone--who's as marvelous a creation as Tony Curtis in <i>The Sweet Smell of Success</i>--and worlds' worth of social caricatures. Kurt Andersen has an uncanny ear for the way we talk now and <i>Turn of the Century</i> is sharp, knowing, and subversive. Let's all pray that it isn't prescient as well. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>The millennium is here. Barbie World has opened in Vegas. Charles Manson's parole hearing is on live TV. And George and Lizzie are a Manhattan power couple with three kids in private school and take-out from Hiroshima Boy waiting at the door. Lizzie owns a software start-up. George is a TV producer. With cell phones tickling their thighs and gossip buzzing in their ears, their future couldn't be brighter. Until, that is, Lizzie cuts a deal with George's boss and gets an office twenty-one floors above her husband's ... Until all the glitter and the hype threaten to destroy George's and Lizzie's sanity and their marriage ... Until the only thing that can save them is a little understanding -- at a time when everyone is talking but no one can hear a thing.<p>In his brash, brilliant first novel, media insider Kurt Andersen casts a penetrating eye on our giddy, media-obsessed era. With a keen sense of irony and a storyteller's grace, the co-founder of Spy magazine weaves a tale that is at once a biting satire of America in the near future and a wickedly incisive portrait of marriage, family, love, and friendship. A crackling, cybercharged joyride through our millennium, Turn of the Century is pure, eye-popping entertainment.</p></p><h2>Chris-Craft (Enthusiast Color)</h2><p>Readers will experience the rumble of powerful inboards and admire the sleek lines of lovingly crafted wood hulls as they cut a wake through this colorful, model-by-model history of Chris-Craft.

He studied printmaking at Wayne State University. He lives with his wife and daughter in Troy, Michigan.</p>*Starred Review* Yee's unassuming picture book evokes the simple joys of an April shower in a wonderfully childlike way. A little girl sits indoors, seemingly trapped in her house by the weather and asking her mother, "Who wants rain?" She finds her own answers after she dons a slicker, a hat, and boots and ventures outdoors. There she discovers that the rain is welcome to many different plants and animals, though not to all. The rhyming text tells the story as naturally as if the rhythm and rhyme just fell into place. On alternate pages, the girl observes the rain in the world around her and asks riddling questions, such as "When it rains, / Who's the first to scat? / I know! Do you? / Mew, mew . . . / It's the cat!" Children who are not usually attracted to quiet picture books will find themselves first drawn in by the guessing game and then rewarded by the entire experience. Fine strokes of color softly define the shapes of characters and settings, visually expressing the many sensory images found in the verse. From a rather sedate child in the first few pictures, the girl gradually changes into an energetic figure actively exploring and discovering how rain transforms her familiar world. Simple and engaging. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><h2>How to Make and Play the Dulcimore.</h2><p>Signed and dated Aug 73 by Hines!

He felt the device&#x2019;s inner workings tick and whir in his palm, sensing the full weight of his destiny. Clearing his mind and his heart, Jim read the mystical incantation inscribed upon the Amulet&#x2019;s back, and said, &#x201c;For the glory of Merlin&#x2014;LET&#x2019;S GET THIS PARTY STARTED!&#x201d;<br> <br>Music thumped through the speakers. Carnival lights lit up Jim&#x2019;s backyard. A WELCOME HOME, JIMBO! banner unfurled. And Jim&#x2019;s best friends&#x2014;Toby, Claire, Blinky, and AAARRRGGHH!!!&#x2014;group-hugged their returned Trollhunter. Well, except for NotEnrique. The little Changeling wasn&#x2019;t too big on public displays of affection.<br> <br>&#x201c;Master Jim!&#x201d; exclaimed Blinky, wiping the tears from his six Troll eyes. &#x201c;I can still scarcely believe that you managed to return from the Darklands&#x2014;and alive, no less!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Glad to have you back,&#x201d; AAARRRGGHH!!! grumbled, tousling Jim&#x2019;s hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;You too, big guy,&#x201d; said Jim.<br> <br>He hugged the giant Troll, happy to hear a heartbeat under all that muscle and fur. Jim reminded himself that it wasn&#x2019;t long ago that a poisoned blade had solidified AAARRRGGHH!!! into a lifeless statue, only for the spirits of past Trollhunters to revive him.<br> <br>&#x201c;We would&#x2019;ve had this shindig a little earlier, if it wasn&#x2019;t for this week&#x2019;s Goblin trouble,&#x201d; Toby said, flashing a braces-filled grin.<br> <br>&#x201c;And under normal circumstances, we&#x2019;d host this celebration at Trollmarket,&#x201d; added Blinky. &#x201c;But I fear Queen Usurna wouldn&#x2019;t look kindly upon honoring the Trollhunter who defied her! Not to mention we don&#x2019;t have much in the way of human party snacks there. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Eh, human food&#x2019;s overrated,&#x201d; said NotEnrique, scarfing down an old gym sock.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of snacks, it&#x2019;s time to unlock the guac!&#x201d; Claire announced.<br> <br>She held out a bowl of her famous guacamole for the group. Jim dipped in a tortilla chip, took a bite, and closed his eyes. He chewed in silence, and Claire tried to read his reaction.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it too bland?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;I can throw a ghost pepper in there for more heat! Or&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Claire,&#x201d; said Jim, opening his eyes and smiling. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect.&#x201d;<br> <br>He hugged her, and his smile spread to the others. Jim looked around at his friends gathered in the backyard and added, &#x201c;The guac, the decorations, the weather, the company&#x2014;it&#x2019;s all perfect.&#x201d;<br> <br>In truth, everything did seem perfect to Jim&#x2014;especially when compared to what he endured in the Darklands. For two weeks Jim fought for his life in the dismal dimension. The only foods he had eaten there were raw Nyarlagroth eggs. The only banners he had seen were the war flags carried by two clashing armies. The only weather he had experienced was the mercilessly cold wind whipping against his Eclipse Armor. And the only company he had kept was the chalk drawing Jim made of his friends&#x2014;that, and a talking fireball who betrayed Jim shortly before trying to kill him. Overall, it had been a pretty weird time for the Trollhunter.<br> <br>The sounds of his teammates&#x2019; laughter roused Jim back to the present. Blinky hoisted a glass of glug into the air and said, &#x201c;And now, in the immortal words of the Venerable Bedehilde: Yo, DJ! Pump up the jamz!&#x201d;<br> <br>NotEnrique popped a vinyl record onto the turntable and cranked up the volume. A blistering Papa Skull track flooded the yard, and Team Trollhunters started dancing. Claire giggled at Jim&#x2019;s patented &#x201c;thumbs-up groove.&#x201d; Blinky popped and locked with all four of his arms. And Toby cheered on AAARRRGGHH!!!, who had picked up a lot of moves from their Go-Go Dance Uprising video game.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go Wingman! Go Wingman! It&#x2019;s your birthday!&#x201d; said Toby.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is the meaning of this?!&#x201d; yelled someone from across the yard.<br> <br>The record needle scratched, and everybody stopped dancing. At first Jim thought they must&#x2019;ve been found out by a neighbor with a noise complaint. How was Jim going to explain to his mom that he was throwing a house party while she worked a night shift at the hospital? Or that he was secretly living a double life as an armored, magically powered champion? Or that Jim had already erased the truth about his Trollhunting from her memory once before? But before Jim could come up with a lame excuse, the party crasher stepped closer. The twinkling carnival lights revealed a blue, broad, and spiked Troll.<br> <br>&#x201c;Draal!&#x201d; Jim hollered.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you possibly have a party . . . without these?&#x201d; said Draal, pulling his mechanical arm from behind his back to reveal three plump watermelons.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s on,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;For the glory of Merlin, Daylight is mine to command!&#x201d;<br> <br>The Amulet floated before Jim and released swarming orbs of pale blue energy. Interlocking metal plates manifested out of the thin air and contracted around Jim&#x2019;s body, sheathing him in radiant armor. The Trollhunter gestured, and the Sword of Daylight appeared in his awaiting hand.<br> <br>Draal hurled all three of the melons. In one fluid stroke, Jim slashed through each of them, splattering the rest of Team Trollhunters with melon chunks. They looked at one another in startled silence&#x2014;then burst into applause.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now that&#x2019;s how you party,&#x201d; said Draal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Draal, any more where those came from?&#x201d; asked Toby, pulling a small hammer from his back pocket.<br> <br>The spiked Troll winked before rolling over to the garden bed, where Jim grew organic fruits, vegetables, and herbs to be used in his cooking. Draal peered between shrubs of thyme and rosemary, finding a fourth, much larger watermelon. He cocked a metal thumbs up to the group, and Toby extended his Warhammer to its full, formidable size. Knowing what was coming next, Jim, Claire, Blinky, and AAARRRGGHH!!! hid behind one of the boulders in the backyard and giggled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Batter up!&#x201d; yelled Toby.<br> <br>As Draal launched the melon like a cannonball, Toby swung his Warhammer with everything he had, the weapon&#x2019;s crystal head trailing amber fire in the night air. The watermelon exploded in a thunderclap of fruit and flame, and the shockwaves sent Toby flying rear-first into Jim&#x2019;s trash cans. With melon juice raining down, NotEnrique cueing a new song, and everyone else hoisting the woozy Toby on their shoulders, Jim felt like he wanted this moment to last forever. The Trollhunter pumped his fists into the air and shouted, &#x201c;This is the greatest night of my life!&#x201d;<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>Much later that night&#x2014;after his guests had picked the last melon seeds from their hair and fur, and left&#x2014;Jim went to sleep with a smile still on his face. But when he heard a strange sound and opened his eyes, Jim discovered he wasn&#x2019;t in his bedroom anymore.<br> <br>He was back in the Darklands. In place of pajamas, Jim now wore the black-and-red Eclipse Armor. Frigid gales whipped his exposed hair, and a photonegative sun shone sickly green light upon the jagged terrain.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no,&#x201d; moaned Jim. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be back here! I&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t ever want to be back here!&#x201d;<br> <br>Overcome with dread, Jim took a step backward, only for the ground to crumble beneath his feet. Jim cried out as he plunged through darkness. He thought he might die this way, falling forever, until the Trollhunter&#x2019;s open hand caught something.<br> <br>It was a chain. The abrupt stop made Jim&#x2019;s shoulder pop out of its socket, but he still managed to hold on to the rusted metal links. Mustering all his strength, Jim pulled himself up the chain. Even the slightest movement sent an agonizing throb running down his arm, but he refused to let go. Blinking away tears, Jim&#x2019;s eyes refocused and saw that he was now clinging on to a bassinet.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Changeling nursery!&#x201d; he gasped.<br> <br>Jim then heard a baby start to cry. The wail came from everywhere and nowhere at once. His armored hand reached into the bassinet, peeling back the blankets. But the more Jim pulled on the fabric, the more folds it seemed to reveal. The bleating cries grew louder, drowning out the sound of the Jim&#x2019;s pounding heartbeat. He finally tore off the last blanket. And the very sight of the horror he unveiled made the Trollhunter scream.<br> <br> � � � <br> <br>Jim&#x2019;s eyes snapped open. He was back in his room, drenched in sweat, jaws clenched. His arm had gone numb, not from a dislocated shoulder, but from sleeping awkwardly on it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whew,&#x201d; sighed Jim, feeling the nightmare fading already. &#x201c;What was in that guac?&#x201d;<br> <br>The alarm clock read 2:00 a.m. There were still four more hours before he had to wake up for school. Relieved, Jim went back to sleep&#x2014;only to sit upright in bed all of a sudden and yell, &#x201c;Holy sheesh-kabobs! I forgot my homework!&#x201d;</p><h2>Chiliad: A Meditation</h2><p>Signed and Numbered limited edition...</p><p>Welcome to the world of Chiliad, an astonishing two-part novella by the incomparable Clive Barker. A brilliantly composed narrative filled with unforgettable images, this visionary meditation on time, history, and human suffering is surely one of Barker's most distinctive&#x2014;and distinguished&#x2014;creations.Chiliad consists of two interrelated stories, stories filtered through the melancholy imagination of a narrator perched on the banks of a river that flows backward and forward through time. The first movement, &#x201c;Men and Sin,&#x201d; takes place in the millennial year of 1000 AD. The second, &#x201c;A Moment at the River's Heart,&#x201d; occurs exactly one thousand years&#x2014;the length of a &#x201c;chiliad&#x201d;&#x2014;later, as the new millennium approaches. At the heart of these stories are two savage, seemingly inexplicable atrocities, each of which reaches across the centuries to reflect and connect with the other. As the narratives unfold and time becomes increasingly permeable, Barker creates a dark, sorrowful portrait of the ancient human capacity for cruelty and destruction. Writing always with lucidity and grace, he addresses a host of universal concerns, among them the power of guilt and grief, and the need to find signs of meaning in the chaos that surrounds us. In the process, he examines the endless chain of consequences that inevitably proceed from a single act of violence.At once hugely expansive and deeply personal, Chiliad is a compact masterpiece, a resonant reminder of Barker's ability to create fictional worlds that enrich and illuminate our own.</p><h2>Tracks</h2><p><p><b>NOW&nbsp;A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE</b><br><br>Robyn Davidson's opens the memoir of her perilous journey across 1,700 miles of hostile Australian desert to the sea with only four camels and a dog for company with the following words: &#x201c;I experienced that sinking feeling you get when you know you have conned yourself into doing something difficult and there's no going back." <br><br>Enduring sweltering heat, fending off poisonous snakes and lecherous men, chasing her camels when they get skittish and nursing them when they are injured, Davidson emerges as an extraordinarily courageous heroine driven by a love of Australia's landscape, an empathy for its indigenous people, and a willingness to cast away the trappings of her former identity.&nbsp;<i>Tracks</i>&nbsp;is the compelling, candid story of her odyssey of discovery and transformation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;An unforgettably powerful book.&#x201d;&#x2014;Cheryl Strayed, author of <i>Wild</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Now with a new postscript by Robyn Davidson.</p></p><p>A cult classic with an ever-growing audience, Tracks is the brilliantly written and frequently hilarious account of a young woman&#39;s odyssey through the deserts of Australia, with no one but her dog and four camels as companions.

In <i>The Second World,</i> the brilliant young scholar Parag Khanna takes readers on a thrilling global tour, one that shows how America&#x2019;s dominant moment has been suddenly replaced by a geopolitical marketplace wherein the European Union and China compete with the United States to shape world order on their own terms. <br><br>This contest is hottest and most decisive in the Second World: pivotal regions in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and East Asia. Khanna explores the evolution of geopolitics through the recent histories of such underreported, fascinating, and complicated countries as Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Colombia, Libya, Vietnam, and Malaysia&#x2013;nations whose resources will ultimately determine the fate of the three superpowers, but whose futures are perennially uncertain as they struggle to rise into the first world or avoid falling into the third.<br><br>Informed, witty, and armed with a traveler&#x2019;s intuition for blending into diverse cultures, Khanna mixes copious research with deep reportage to remake the map of the world. He depicts second-world societies from the inside out, observing how globalization divides them into winners and losers along political, economic, and cultural lines&#x2013;and shows how China, Europe, and America use their unique imperial gravities to pull the second-world countries into their orbits. Along the way, Khanna also explains how Arabism and Islamism compete for the Arab soul, reveals how Iran and Saudi Arabia play the superpowers against one another, unmasks Singapore&#x2019;s inspirational role in East Asia, and psychoanalyzes the second-world leaders whose decisions are reshaping the balance of power. He captures the most elusive formula in international affairs: how to think like a country.<br><br>In the twenty-first century, globalization is the main battlefield of geopolitics, and America itself runs the risk of descending into the second world if it does not renew itself and redefine its role in the world. <br><br>Comparable in scope and boldness to Francis Fukuyama&#x2019;s <i>The End of History and the Last Man </i>and Samuel P. Huntington&#x2019;s <i>The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order</i>, Parag Khanna&#x2019;s <i>The Second World </i>will be the definitive guide to world politics for years to come.<br><br>&#x201c;A savvy, streetwise primer on dozens of individual countries that adds up to a coherent theory of global politics.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Robert D.

By themselves those pages are worth the price of a book that from beginning to end inspires reflection."<br><i>&#x2013;Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>Parag Khanna directs the Global Governance Initiative in the American Strategy Program of the New America Foundation. He has been a fellow at the Brookings Institution and worked for the World Economic Forum and the Council on Foreign Relations. During 2007, he was a senior geopolitical advisor to U.S. Special Operations Command. Born in India, Khanna was raised in the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Germany. He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and is completing his Ph.D. at the London School of Economics. He has written for major global publications such as <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Financial Times</i> and appeared on CNN and other television media around the world. Having traveled in close to one hundred countries. He is a member of the Explorers Club.Khanna, a widely recognized expert on global politics, offers an study of the 21st century's emerging geopolitical marketplace dominated by three first world superpowers, the U.S., Europe and China. Each competes to lead the new century, pursuing that goal in the third world: select eastern European countries, east and central Asia, the Middle East Latin America, and North Africa. The U.S. offers military protection and aid. Europe offers deep reform and economic association. China offers full-service, condition-free relationships. Each can be appealing; none has obvious advantages. The key to Khanna's analysis, however, is his depiction of a second world: countries in transition. They range in size and population from heavily peopled states like Brazil and Indonesia to smaller ones such as Malaysia. Khanna interprets the coming years as being shaped by the race to win the second world&#x2014;and in the case of the U.S., to avoid becoming a second-world country itself. The final pages of his book warn eloquently of the risks of imperial overstretch combined with declining economic dominance and deteriorating quality of life. By themselves those pages are worth the price of a book that from beginning to end inspires reflection. <i>(Mar. 11)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The carefully selected preaching units and focused commentary allow pastors to quickly grasp the big idea and key themes of each passage of Scripture. Each unit of the commentary includes the big idea and key themes of the passage and sections dedicated to understanding, teaching, and illustrating the text.</p><p><b>Focused Biblical Scholarship to Teach the Text Effectively<br><br></b>The Teach the Text Commentary Series gives pastors the best of biblical scholarship and presents the information needed to move seamlessly from the meaning of the text to its effective communication. By keeping the discussion in each carefully selected preaching unit to six pages of focused commentary, the volumes allow pastors to quickly grasp the most important information. Each unit of the commentary includes the big idea and key themes of the passage; sections dedicated to understanding, teaching, and illustrating the text; and full-color images.<br><br>To many Christians, the book of Revelation is either an inscrutable enigma to avoid or a detailed blueprint of the end of history over which to obsess. Both approaches tend to miss the book's rich teachings about God Almighty, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, God's people, worship, spiritual warfare, perseverance, judgment, and more. Scott Duvall unpacks Revelation with an emphasis on both historical and literary contexts, helping the modern teacher and reader focus on the book's messages of warning, hope, and comfort, remembering that Jesus is Lord. Revelation issues a clarion call to faithful living in the face of the threat of persecution and the temptation to compromise, a call we need to hear today.<br><br>"Scott Duvall's volume on Revelation can only be described as magnificent in every respect. This well-written commentary is characterized from beginning to end by careful interpretation, insightful theological analysis, and extremely helpful and applicable illustrations. Students, teachers, pastors, and scholars will all benefit from Duvall's significant contribution to the study of this challenging book. I gladly and heartily recommend this fine work."--<b>David S. Dockery</b>, president, Trinity International University<br><br>"Duvall reliably guides contemporary readers to the message that John conveyed to his readers in the first century, he consistently focuses on the biblical text rather than on the various theories and interpretations, and he responsibly helps pastors and Bible study leaders to teach, preach, and apply John's message as God's message to the church today."--<b>Eckhard J. Schnabel</b>, Mary F. Rockefeller Distinguished Professor of New Testament, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary<br><br>"Duvall has done a splendid job of providing clarity to an often misunderstood segment of Scripture.

Unfortunately, though, the muddled plot and strangely dazed protagonists make for a disappointingly dreary read. It's the summer of 1854, and London is in the grip of another cholera epidemic. Dr. John Snow, a reclusive British scientist (and the only nonfictional character in the book), works tirelessly among the dying in an effort to substantiate his claim that the source of cholera lies in contaminated water. Little does Snow know that the beautiful but haunted Lillian Aynsworth, an Indian-born Englishwoman he meets at a post-opera gathering, has just arrived from the Indian island where the plague first erupted and where most of her father's household succumbed. John falls instantly for Lillian, and Lillian for John, despite the fact that both their lives are in a terrible mess: Snow's due to the public ridicule and aversion caused by his work; Aynwsorth's due to a scandalous illegitimate still-birth lurking in her past. Alone against the world, the two band defiantly together to prove Snow's hypothesis despite frequent, baffling physical attacks in London's back alleyways, attempted blackmail by an envious older scientist, and the shocking appearances of Lillian's supposedly dead former lover and son. Emerging in 1855 triumphant--in both research and love-- the bloodied but unbowed detectives look forward to cohabitating happily ever after--except that, as the author points out, the real Snow died less than four years later. Taylor's portrayal of foggy, gloomy Victorian London is superb, but her characters' thickheadedness makes for a frustrating and unsatisfying thriller. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The severe cholera epidemic that terrorized London in the summer of 1854 provides the atmospheric background for Taylor's nicely written first novel, and a real-life figure, Dr. John Snow, is its protagonist. Noted physician Snow sets out to prove that contaminated water causes the disease, but corrupt water-company officials hire thugs to deter his investigation, and the medical establishment rejects his theory. Romance enters in the form of Lillian Aynsworth, raised in India, who sails for England after her father dies of cholera. She falls in love with the doctor and helps with the maps on which he is trying to correlate cholera deaths with contaminated water sites. The busy plot abounds with Victorian skullduggery and dark secrets, including one from Lillian's past that threatens to separate the lovers. In an afterword, immunologist Taylor tells us that, although Snow's conclusions were not accepted in his lifetime, "since then, he has been fully credited as the discoverer of the cause of cholera." She keeps her narrative--about one-third historical fact and two-thirds old-fashioned romance--moving briskly with a wide variety of villains, a chase through the London sewers and a well-drawn overview of urban life in the 1850s. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Masterful Marks: Cartoonists Who Changed the World</h2><p>In a first-of-its-kind collection, award-winning illustrators celebrate the lives of the visionary artists who created the world of comic art and altered pop culture forever.<br><br>Sixteen Graphic Novel Biographies of:<br> <br>� Walt Disney � Dr. Seuss � Charles Schulz � The Creators of Superman � R.

Its timeless advice and celebration of the joys of fishing still captivate modern readers. Packed with anecdotes and commentaries, it details methods for catching and preparing everything from salmon to trout.</p><p>For a book to stay in print for nearly 350 years, its merits must continually entice and satisfy. <i>The Compleat Angler</i> qualifies on both counts. On the most obvious level, it remains as good a primer on fishing as any angler would want. But its most enduring distinction is hinted at in the subtitle--"the Contemplative Man's Recreation." Izaak Walton's sometimes convoluted 17th-century grammar can still reel in our imaginations with his graceful evocations of a life free from hurly-burly in the company of friends intent on physical and moral sustenance. "He that hopes to be a good Angler must not only bring an inquiring, searching, observing wit," suggests the master, "but he must bring a large measure of hope and patience.... Doubt not but Angling will prove to be so pleasant, that it will prove to be like a virtue, a reward to itself." Just like Walton's magnificent literary catch. --<i>Jeff Silverman</i>[[The first unabridged cast reading. Features original song compositions.

Pippin</h2><p>A lyrical and biographical reflection on the art and life of Horace H. Pippin the best-known African American artist of his time <i>Primitive</i> offers a searching critique of the condescension to African American folk art as supposedly primitive,&#x201d; and it also critiques the underestimation of African American life and imagination in the broader American consciousness. Award-winning poet Janice N. Harrington connects readers to this fascinating, odds-defying artist, all while underscoring the human craving for artistic expression.<br></p><p>Janice N. Harrington writes poetry and children's books. She grew up in Alabama and Nebraska, and both those settings, especially rural Alabama, figure largely in her writing. Her first book of poetry, <i>Even the Hollow My Body Made Is Gone</i> (2007), won the A. Poulin, Jr. Poetry Prize from BOA Editions and the Kate Tufts Discovery Award. She is also the author of <i>The Hands of Strangers: Poems from the Nursing Home</i> (BOA Editions, 2011). Her children's books, <i>The Chicken Chasing Queen of Lamar County</i> (2007) and <i>Going North</i> (2004), both from Farrar, Straus and Giroux, have won many awards and citations, including a listing among TIME Magazine's top 10 children's books of 2007 and the Ezra Jack Keats Award from the New York Public Library in 2005. A Cave Canem Fellow, she is also the winner of a 2007 National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellowship for Poetry. Harrington's poetry appears regularly in American literary magazines. She has worked as a public librarian and as a professional storyteller, performing at festivals around the country, including the National Storytelling Festival. She currently teaches in the creative writing program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br>In her innovative and incisive third book of poems, <i>Primitive</i>, Janice N. Harrington shows us the great revelations possible in the intersections of history and poetry. These elegantly-crafted poems explore the aftermath of war, Jim Crow America, and American visual art through the life and art of the painter Horace H. Pippin. This collection is both a historical reflection and an ekphrastic object, masterfully rendered from found texts, paintings, notebooks, and the ephemera surrounding the painter and his work. It is through Pippin&#x2019;s pictures and pigments, both paint and skin, that we see the complex beauty of the artist a beauty that announces itself in bold colors in spite of the bigger machines of oppression that so often worked in opposition to his artistry.&#x201d;<br><br><b> Adrian Matejka</b><br><br> In <i>Primitive</i>, the artist Horace H. Pippin is less a lens and more a prism through which Janice N. Harrington watches humanity with a careful eye. Harrington&#x2019;s skill with image is undeniable, and her ability to intertwine ekphrasis, biography, history, and interior landscape results in a text that is much more than a book of poems without ever ceasing to be a moving and radiant example of one.&#x201d;<br><br><b> Jamaal May</b><br><br>"This collection not only recalls specific paintings by Pippin but returns to the ideas of satisfaction emerging in the process of painting, and painting exactly what he saw. These two recurring ideas lend weight to his experiences as a veteran during the Jim Crow era. Harrington gracefully honors Pippin&#x2019;s words and work through her spare lines, strong sense of narrative, and subtle sonic repetitions."<br><br><b> <i> Publishers Weekly</i></b><br></p><h2>Neutron Star</h2><p>Come to Larry Niven's Universe and meet all the natives: Thrints, Bandersnatchi, Puppeteers -- and a host of other wonderfully created characters.<br>Visit Lookitthat, Down, and Jinx -- indeed, an entire galaxy of planets found only in these stories that trace man's expansion and colonization throughout Known Space.<br>A spectacular cycle of the future . . . a 10,000-year history of man on Earth and in space!</p><p>Larry Niven has won the prestigious Hugo Award five times.

We are reminded that God uses weak and fearful pastors in plants and revitalizations; church planting is indeed for "wimps."

The descriptions are sensual, and the unusual similes and metaphors occasionally change perspective unexpectedly. <i>Angel of Oblivion</i> deals with harrowing subjects - murder, torture, persecution and discrimination of an ethnic minority - in intricate and lyrical prose.<br>The novel tells the story of a family from the Slovenian minority in Austria. The first-person narrator starts off with her childhood memories of rural life, in a community anchored in the past. Yet behind this rural idyll, an unresolved conflict is smouldering. At first, the child wonders about the border to Yugoslavia, which runs not far away from her home. Then gradually the stories that the adults tell at every opportunity start to make sense. All the locals are scarred by the war. Her grandfather, we find out, was a partisan fighting the Nazis from forest hideouts. Her grandmother was arrested and survived Ravensbr�ck.<br><br>As the narrator grows older, she finds out more. Through conversations at family gatherings and long nights talking to her grandmother, she learns that her father was arrested by the Austrian police and tortured - at the age of ten - to extract information on the whereabouts of his father. Her grandmother lost her foster-daughter and many friends and relatives in Ravensbr�ck and only escaped the gas chamber by hiding inside the camp itself. The narrator begins to notice the frequent suicides and violent deaths in her home region, and she develops an eye for how the Slovenians are treated by the majority of German-speaking Austrians. As an adult, the narrator becomes politicised and openly criticises the way in which Austria deals with the war and its own Nazi past. In the closing section, she visits Ravensbr�ck and finds it strangely lifeless - realising that her personal memories of her grandmother are stronger.<br><br>Illuminating an almost forgotten chapter of European history and the European present, the book deals with family dynamics scarred by war and torture - a dominant grandmother, a long-suffering mother, a violent father who loves his children but is impossible to live with. And interwoven with this is compelling reflection on storytelling: the narrator hoping to rid herself of the emotional burden of her past and to tell stories on behalf of those who cannot.</p><p>MAJA HADERLAP is a Slovenian-German Austrian writer and translator.

Includes overview of life styles of each island. Over 100 photos and 16 pages of color photos. Concise and thorough, it&#39;s designed to help decide whether paradise is for you.</p><p>As reporter, editor and columnist at newspapers in Pennsylvnaia and Florida, Toni Polancy covered stories that ranged from murder to meatballs, politics to polygamy. After 23 years in journalism, she sacrificed a job as managing editor of daily newspaper to move to Hawaii. The islands had a nasty reputation for luring newcomers only to cast them adrift on a treacherous sea of high prices, low wages and scarce jobs, so Polancy brought her own business. She started successful magazines on Maui and Kauai.Hawaii. Paradise. Gentle breezes, sunshine, coconuts and bananas falling into your lap, beautiful scenery, great recreational opportunities. All true (well, almost all), and all there for the tourist. But what about permanent residents? Polancy's guide is essential for anyone seriously contemplating relocation. A Kauai entrepreneur learned only after the fact that her home-operated business would be severely hampered by the limit of only one telephone line in her condo and the absence of home postal delivery, with a year-long wait for a P.O. box. While a military assignment can be considered a transfer to paradise, the financial realities, including higher rent, insurance, utilities, and food, may cause a plunge into personal bankruptcy. Polancy provides useful information on the pluses and minuses of each island, facilities for children, and such delights as tsunamis and hurricanes, rats, head lice, roaches, crime, and DUI penalties. Read this first if you're thinking of moving to paradise. Highly recommended for large public libraries.?Thomas K.

She has never chosen to write about her own life or what made her into a gatherer of other people's stories, until now, in <i>Found and Lost</i>. <br><br>Starting with her childhood experience of running her primary school 'Lost and Found' depot, Gold charts the origin of her need to save objects, stories, people - including herself - whom she has sensed to be on a road to perdition. After a series of deaths of people close to her (mother, lover, mentor, friend), she develops, though a series of letters, a meditation on aging, friendship, loss and the forces that link us to the dead. The letters tell of her early activism; her descent into alcoholism and subsequent recovery; and they tell of her discovery of the power of writing to give shape and meaning to a life. <i>Found and Lost</i> is both a tender memorial to the extraordinary people in her life, and a compelling tale of redemption.</p><p><b>Alison Leslie Gold</b>'s works include <i>Anne Frank Remembered</i>, written with Miep Gies, <i>Memories of Anne Frank: Reflections of a Childhood Friend</i>, <i>A Special Fate</i> and <i>Fiet's Vase and Other Stories of Survival</i>.

She has also published fiction, including <i>Clairvoyant </i>and <i>The Devil's Mistress</i>, the latter being nominated for a National Book Award.

Figurative art in particular has the potential to convey the emotional essence of an individual at a particular moment in time. Pivotal artworks representing the human form - such as Nike of Samothrace (the Winged Victory), ca. 200-190 B.C.; Michelangelo&#39;s David, 1501-1504; and Auguste Rodin&#39;s The Thinker, 1880 - have inspired both audiences and artists for centuries. An artist&#39;s desire to express form and feeling can infuse an artwork with a quality that withstands the passage of time. Sharing this desire for universal expression, Richard MacDonald creates dynamic, sensitive works using a range of media, reflecting both the artist&#39;s passion and the variety of human passions that make us who we are.</p><h2>Whole: An Honest Look at the Holes in Your Life--and How to Let God Fill Them</h2><p><b>How to get past whatever&#x2019;s holding you back&#x2015;and start living a whole new story</b><br><br>We all have holes in our lives&#x2015;those things we lament about ourselves.

In her trademark bold, compassionate, and relatable voice, Lisa takes you on a transformational journey of understanding who you really are . . . and what you were born to be and do.</p><p>Lisa Whittle, the author of three books, is a not-your-typical ministry leader whose past experiences include writing for Women of Faith and Catalyst, church planting, and traveling with Compassion International.

In crisp, clear diction she focuses on three areas of life that commonly have &#x201c;holes&#x201d;: religion, roles, and experiences. Matching voice to mood, she portrays her transformational healing journey, richly recounting how God spun the things she most disliked about herself into healing and complete wholeness. Her characterization of how God was the hammer and she was the nail He hammered brings tears. As she describes her feelings and struggles at pivotal moments in her life, her voice captures the emotions of her journey. Ultimately, she learns to draw close to God, accept His love and grace, and become the woman He created her to be."&nbsp; <br>G.W. � AudioFile Portland, Maine<br></p><h2>You Can&#39;t Win: The Autobiography of Jack Black</h2><p>The author looks back on his life and describes his experiences among bums, hobos, and thieves</p><p></p><h2>The Hidden Manna: A Theology of the Eucharist</h2><p>The Hidden Manna: A Theology of the EucharistBy Fr.

Focusing on the doctrine of the Real Presence, he follows the earliest witnesses through the challenge in the Middle Ages of Berengarius to the Protestant Reformation and modern disputes. Both historically and theologically, the author treats the Real Presence, Transubstantiation, the Eucharist as pledge and foretaste of heaven, as sacrifice, as the Sacrament of Sacraments. He also shows the relationship between the Eucharist and the Church and the Eucharist and Our Lady.The great theologians and Fathers of the Church that O&#39;Connor draws upon include St. Ignatius</p><p></p><h2>Godly Play Volume 5: Practical Helps from Godly Play Trainers</h2><p><p>The authors of volume 5 are nearly all accredited Godly Play trainers.

Humans, Niebuhr says, are incapable of perfect love. Therefore, their struggle against evil and injustice is doomed to only relative victory, although they strive to live in the ideal world. Niebuhr's concern with this paradox gave rise to numerous writings over the years in which he explored the many angles, subtleties, heights, and depths of the problems of humanity and society. Now sixty-four of these important pieces are compiled in a single volume, providing evidence of Niebuhr's belief that positive decisions and actions are possible for Christians.</p><p>The Library of Theological Ethics series focuses on what it means to think theologically and ethically. It presents a selection of important and otherwise unavailable texts in easily accessible form. Volumes in this series will enable sustained dialogue with predecessors though reflection on classic works in the field.</p></p><p><b>Reinhold Niebuhr</b> (1892 - 1971) was an ethicist, theologian, and political philosopher who taught at Union Theological Seminary in New York City from 1928 to 1960.

The Kinnesons of Kingdom Mountain had always been great readers. Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays. Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress. Paradise Lost. His mother had delighted in reading Miss Austen and Mr. Dickens to Morgan and his brother. Their father, Quaker Meeting Kinneson, read aloud regularly from the papers and gazettes out of Boston, Washington, and Philadelphia. After Pilgrim left Kingdom Mountain for Harvard, he sent Morgan books by his professor and friend, the Swiss-born naturalist and glaciologist Louis Agassiz, and by Emerson and Thoreau, the Concord freethinkers, and, most recently, the book by that strange Englishman Darwin, which was like no other book Morgan had ever read.<br><br>Of course the Vermont Kinnesons also read the Bible. The elderly female cousin several times removed who had quartered herself upon the family since his father was a boy had read to Morgan, with a satisfaction bordering on gleefulness, the vengeful old scriptures of cataclysmic floods and fi re raining out of the sky to incinerate entire wicked cities, and wicked giants laid low by boys with slings, not to mention women turned into salt for the least imaginable infraction, and innumerable millions wailing and gnashing their teeth in everlasting fi res for reciting their prayers one way instead of another. &#x201c;Take from the Bible what you can use and ignore the rest,&#x201d; Pilgrim had advised him. &#x201c;Just as you would from any other book. It&#x2019;s the book our ancestors were raised on. It can&#x2019;t be all bad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the book I was raised on,&#x201d; said the elderly cousin many times removed, whose name was Mahitabel, but whom Pilgrim and Morgan called Cousin Sabbath School. She gave Pilgrim a dark look. &#x201c;It has served me well. It will serve him&#x201d;&#x2014;meaning Morgan&#x2014;&#x201c;well. When he is judged, at the end of what I prophesy will be a short and ill-spent life, he will know why he has been consigned. There will be no brook fi shing or roving off night and day there, I assure you.&#x201d; Exactly where Morgan would be consigned, Cousin Sabbath School never specified. <br><br>&#x201c;That sounds like the kind of threat a brimstone preacher would make to scare a fellow into going along with his way of thinking,&#x201d; Pilgrim said. &#x201c;Around comes the long-handled collection basket, boys. Pay your dues or it will go hard with you by and by.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We shall see what we shall see,&#x201d; Mahitabel said.<br><br>&#x201c;On that much, at least, we can all agree,&#x201d; Morgan&#x2019;s father said, hoping thereby to end the discussion.<br><br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; said Cousin Sabbath School. &#x201c;We can.&#x201d;<br><br>Of all the Kinnesons, Pilgrim, who was fi ve years older than Morgan, was the most voracious reader. He studied books about medicine and trees and animals and rocks. Until he went to war he had been studying at Harvard to become a doctor. He had even spent a year studying surgery with Joseph Lister at the renowned medical college in Glasgow, Scotland. Before leaving home for Harvard and beyond, he had taught Morgan a good deal about the animals and plants and birds of Kingdom Mountain. He had shown Morgan how to shoot with Hunter, Pilgrim&#x2019;s old cap-and-ball musket, converted from their grandfather&#x2019;s fl intlock. And while Morgan quickly became a good shot, his brother remained the expert marksman in the family. Even after he had stopped hunting, stopped killing things altogether, Pilgrim was the best shot Morgan had ever known. For his part, Morgan had an uncanny natural woods sense, which he had honed ever since he had been allowed to go to the woods on his own. As his father sometimes said, you couldn&#x2019;t haul the boy out of the woods with a yoke of oxen, though he too read avidly himself, travel accounts mainly, by explorers like Marco Polo and Captain James Cook. As for Morgan&#x2019;s formal schooling, that had ended after the episode with Dogood.<br><br>In a way it had been the Kinneson mania for reading that had resulted in Pilgrim&#x2019;s trouble as well. In the third year of fighting, Pilgrim had enlisted in the Union army. Like his father, who operated the northernmost station on Vermont&#x2019;s Underground Railroad, Pilgrim was an abolitionist. But the rift with Professor Agassiz had led to his leaving college to enlist. It was Darwin&#x2019;s <i>Origin of Species</i> that had resulted in the break, though by then Pilgrim and his parents had already quarreled over the matter of Manon Thibeau. Not that Morgan believed there was any lesson to be learned from such refl ections. You couldn&#x2019;t just stop reading, any more than you could help falling in love. Still, he had to acknowledge, at least to himself, that reading was the main problem, as true in his case as it was in Pilgrim&#x2019;s. If he&#x2019;d never encountered those travel books, he might never have come up with the idea for his own great odyssey after Pilgrim had gone missing at the place in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg.<br><br>For a time after Pilgrim went off to college, Morgan dreaded going to places on Kingdom Mountain that he and his older brother had once frequented. Places where Pilgrim had taught him to wait for a buck to slip down to a stream to drink. Brooks where they&#x2019;d caught the vividly colored little native trout that lived in every rill on the mountain. The big lake, Memphremagog, which stretched twenty-five miles north into French Canada, where they&#x2019;d watched the snow geese alight, thousands of them, sailing out of the dense clouds in family gaggles of four and fi ve and six on their way north to Baffi n Bay or south to the Chesapeake. Once, while they were trolling on the lake in the birch canoe they had made, Morgan had hooked a huge deepwater fi sh, probably a lake trout but possibly a sturgeon. The fi sh had towed the canoe for almost a mile over the border, between the steep mountains rising abruptly three thousand feet out of the water, before breaking off with Morgan&#x2019;s homemade red-and-white lure in its mouth. The two brothers loved to camp overnight on top of Kingdom Mountain, high above the treeline, where you could see four different states and deep into Canada. One night, tenting on the mountaintop with their cousin Dolton Kinneson, a great bear of a fellow who was Pilgrim&#x2019;s age but in his head much younger than Morgan, they&#x2019;d watched the entire northern sky fl are blue, green, red, silver, yellow, and pink from the northern lights. Pilgrim had told them about the Canadian voyageurs, fur traders in colorful tuques and sashes, who paddled thirty-foot-long canots du nord in grand flotillas from Montreal to Lake Athabasca and a place with the wonderful name of Flin Flon&#x2014;twenty-fi ve hundred miles and back again, racing to beat the onset of winter, singing their stirring paddling songs, penetrating wilderness never before seen by anyone save a few scattered bands of Cree. At twelve and thirteen and fourteen, Morgan had longed to go north with these bold adventurers.<br><br>He and Pilgrim and Dolton had brought Professor Agassiz to the mountaintop to examine the glacial erratics, boulders carried down from the Far North by the great ice sheet. They&#x2019;d showed him the Balancing Boulder, a gigantic round rock as big as their farmhouse, perched on a smaller fl at-topped boulder, with strange glyphs that the professor called runes carved into it beside pictographs of a whale, a walrus, and a reindeer. The professor believed that the pictographs and the runes might have been carved by Norse explorers hundreds of years before, but neither he nor anyone else could tell for certain. Only that the carvings were very ancient. Sometimes Morgan and Pilgrim played a variation of blindman&#x2019;s bluff at the Balancing Boulder, shutting their eyes and reaching for the boulder to see which rune they touched most often. Even when he tried not to, Morgan usually touched the symbol ~ Pilgrim ~. <br><br>At all of these familiar places Morgan had felt terrible pangs of loneliness ever since Pilgrim had gone missing in Pennsylvania. The plan had been taking shape in his mind for some weeks. After Pilgrim went off to war he continued to write to Morgan, though not to their parents. He told Morgan that he felt they were still close in spirit because they both loved the same places on the mountain. Pilgrim had liked to josh, calling Morgan &#x201c;soldier&#x201d; or &#x201c;Natty,&#x201d; after Natty Bumppo, the fabled scout in Fenimore Cooper&#x2019;s novels. Morgan&#x2019;s parents were too serious-minded to do much joshing. As for the aged cousin, she had never joshed in her life.<br><br>&#x201c;Did Lord Jesus of Nazareth sit around the woodstove cracking wise with his cronies?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Did he, cousin?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe not,&#x201d; Morgan&#x2019;s father admitted.<br><br>&#x201c;I believe not, too,&#x201d; Mahitabel said quite viciously. &#x201c;Lord Jesus of Nazareth never laughed in his life. Not once. Nor did Paul.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Laughing wasn&#x2019;t Jesus&#x2019; department,&#x201d; Morgan&#x2019;s father conceded.<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t Paul&#x2019;s department either, from what I can gather about Paul.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They knew that laughter is a sin,&#x201d; Mahitabel said. &#x201c;That laughter besmirches the creation. I detest laughter.&#x201d;<br><br>The old woman opened her daybook, in which she kept a careful running account of all that she detested, along with clippings of crimes and atrocities culled from the gazettes Morgan&#x2019;s father subscribed to. &#x201c;Look you,&#x201d; she said, removing a cutting from the Washington Intelligencer of two weeks ago. &#x201c;Do you call this funny? Do you laugh at this?&#x201d; The heading read, fi ve hardened killers escape from york state prison camp. Below, in smaller type, &#x201c;Family of Four Found Hanged.

Originating in 1775 as disorganized, local violence over rights and taxes, it quickly escalated into full-blown armed conflict. By the time the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783 - after six years of war - a new nation had emerged. Offering a day-by-day chronology of the people and events important to the American Revolution, Revolutionary War Almanac provides an up-close look at this historic time. The A-to-Z dictionary covers people, battles, and other exciting details. More than 130 maps, photographs, and illustrations pair with a detailed index, a bibliography, cross-references, and a chronology to make this reference more accessible than any other.</p><p>John C. Fredriksen holds a Ph.D. in American history from Providence College. He works as a freelance writer and researcher, and is the author of American Military Leaders and Facts On File&#39;s Biographical Dictionary of Modern World Leaders.This no-nonsense compendium is intended for serious researchers and offers a considerable amount of information in an accessible and manageable format. Coverage is limited to war-specific material: campaigns, politics, diplomacy, and individuals who were directly involved. There are two main sections: a chronology and a historical dictionary. The day-by-day chronology spans two decades (1763-1783) and tracks significant developments on various fronts: regional battles and skirmishes, diplomatic and political maneuverings, and so on. Events are described in single sentences or brief paragraphs and are preceded by boldface subheadings ("Caribbean," "North," "South," "Naval," etc.) that alert researchers to pertinent information while allowing for rapid skimming. <p>The second section, the historical dictionary, consists of alphabetically arranged articles that range from a few paragraphs to a few pages. These entries address people, places, events, and broad topics such as <i>African Americans</i> and <i>Privateering.</i> Every entry concludes with a list of print resources (monographs, periodicals, dissertations, etc.). Additional print sources are listed in a general bibliography that covers Revolutionary War scholarship published between 2000 and 2005.</p><p>An extensive appendix of maps details campaigns and individual land and sea battles. Occasional black-and-white illustrations are scattered throughout the dictionary section. These are primarily portraits from national museums and portrait galleries and military institutes. Author Fredriksen indicates in his introduction that the illustrations not only depict individuals normally overlooked in standard treatments but also bring images of some Revolutionary War-era contemporaries together in print for the first time. </p><p>This is the inaugural volume of Facts On File's Almanacs of American Wars series. <i>Korean War Almanac</i> is also in print, and future offerings will address the Civil War, the war in Vietnam, and World Wars I and II. The current offering provides a needed update to Revolutionary War research and is recommended for upper-secondary and academic collections and large public libraries. <i>Kathleen McBroom</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

She advocated pacifism yet fought alongside anarchists in Spain. Born in Paris to wealthy Jewish parents, she embraced her own semimystical version of Catholicism while seeking "a philosophical cleansing of the Catholic religion." Weil worked in a factory, lived an ascetic existence, neglected her health, slept on floors. She displayed, in Fiori's words, an "inner infantilism" that combined extreme purity of heart with an inability to accept the life of a grown woman. Weil died in 1943 of self-starvation, leaving behind notebooks and essays in which she poured out her thoughts on the need for a spiritual-political regeneration to overcome Nazi pseudo-religion and Soviet-style workers' bureaucracy. This empathetic philosophical biography by a retired Italian teacher only partially succeeds in illuminating her complex character. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Symposium of Plato</h2><p>We are currently updating our website and have not yet posted complete information for this title.

But when Joe&#39;s travelling companion, a Russian opera singer, is shot dead at his side on the road to Simla, he finds himself plunged into a murder investigation. As Joe begins to unravel the mystery which has its roots in the aftermath of the First World War, he discovers that behind the sparkling facade of Simla lies a trail of murder, vice and blackmail.</p><p>Barbara Cleverly is the author of nine novels of historical suspense, including <b>The Damascened Blade</b>, winner of the CWA Ellis Peters Historical Dagger Award, <b>The Last Kashmiri Rose, Ragtime in Simla, The Palace Tiger, The Bee&#x2019;s Kiss, Tug of War, </b><i>An Old Magic </i>and <b>The Tomb of Zeus</b>.

Her charge remained willfully oblivious and continued to turn her head excitedly, drinking in the strange sounds and bustle of the Gare de Lyon refreshment room, still elegant in spite of four years of wartime neglect.<br><br>Alice sighed, and in pursuit of a world-weary image lay back against the buttoned leather upholstery of the banquette. Like the second barrel of a shotgun, inevitably came: "Don't loll, dear!"<br><br>Alice continued to loll and turned to her companion with a mutinous expression. Fearing that she might just have gone too far (for the moment), Maud said in a placatory tone, "You need not, Alice, feel obliged to finish your cup of tea. The French really have no idea . . ." The monument of corseted rectitude creaked forward slightly to take up her own cup and, while deploring the dire French habit of putting the water in the pot before the tea leaves, determined, nevertheless, to set a good example. "Always finish what is put in front of you," even if it is a cup of badly brewed tea.<br><br>Alice didn't take the hint but continued to stare enviously at the drink in the hand of the Frenchwoman sitting opposite. Frothy and pink, it fizzed seductively in a tall glass and Maud had no doubt, to judge by the appearance of the woman sipping it, that it contained alcohol. To her horror, Alice leaned forward and addressed the woman. In English public school French.<br><br>"Excusez-moi, madame, mais qu'est-ce que c'est que cette . . . er . . . boisson?"<br><br>"Alice!" hissed Maud, bristling with indignation. "You don't address a perfect stranger! What will she think?"<br><br>The woman in question put down the enviable pink drink and, after a moment of well-bred surprise, replied in scarcely accented English and with a charming smile of friendship. "It is called a Campari-soda. Very refreshing and very French." And without pause she turned to a passing waiter and said, "Monsieur, un Campari-soda pour mademoiselle, s'il vous plait!"<br><br>Alice's face lit up with a smile of guilty delight. Maud Benson closed her eyes and pursed her lips.<br><br>They were only three hundred miles into their journey and Maud shuddered at the thought that there were at least seven thousand more to be survived in the company of this girl. Alice Conyers. Time and again she had warned her charge, "This is France. You're not in Hertfordshire now and the company is very mixed. You should avoid getting involved with strangers. And, above all, avoid a certain type of woman. Yes, woman. One learns to recognize the type. It's easy to connect with such people but not so easy to disconnect. A good rule is 'never talk to strangers.' " She didn't know what more she could have said. And yet . . . "For all the good I've done, I might as well have been playing the flute!"<br><br>Discreetly, she palmed a bismuth tablet into her mouth. A martyr to indigestion, she had learned to take this precaution at the first sign of stress.<br><br>Maud recalled the briefing her Principal had given her before this assignment had begun. "Out of the top drawer, Miss Benson. Rich family. Best of prospects. Your charge is going out to India where she is to assume the reins of power, it would seem, at the head of the family business--I'm speaking of the great commercial house Imperial and Colonial--at least, half the reins of power since she is, very sensibly, to share that eminence with a second cousin. Sad recent history--deaths in the family--so you must be prepared for a gloomy little companion, I'm afraid."<br><br>(Maud felt a little gloom and becoming mourning would be preferred to this ceaseless chatter and frivolous curiosity.)<br><br>"She is not straight out of the schoolroom, she is twenty-one years old, but has led a very sheltered life in Hertfordshire. Her grandfather's executors have expressed a requirement for a highly dependable and experienced traveling chaperone and naturally they came to us."<br><br>First impressions had been good on the whole. Though pretty enough (and this was always a concern), the girl had appeared sensible and well spoken. Her manners were those of the lady she was and rather old-fashioned. She seemed to have none of that brash giddiness that some modern young girls affected and which could give such trouble on board a P&amp;O steamer. Her wardrobe consisted of entirely suitable clothes in mourning colours of black and grey appropriate to a girl who had recently lost not just her only brother on the battlefield mere days before the war had ended but also her father and mother to the flu the previous year. And, to cap it all, her grandfather, Lord Rupert Conyers, whose death, in the words of the Times obituary, "was occasioned by a fall from his horse while hunting with the Essex and Suffolk Foxhounds" the previous December.<br><br>Maud had hoped for an undemanding run through to Bombay but was aware that the major challenge to effective chaperonage was in the three-week-long sea passage. The steamers were crowded with stylish young army officers returning to India from home leave. Many were looking for eligible wives, always in short supply in India. They had charm; they had slim, active figures and a look of suntanned alertness. Maud was well aware of the dangers and, in spite of her clever stratagems and unsleeping vigilance, had presided, in her time, unwillingly, over no fewer than three engagements (one, at least, most unsuitable) during her traveling career and had lost count of the number of broken hearts.<br><br>But she decided she need have no fears for Alice Conyers. The girl had confided early in their journey that she had the greatest hopes of marrying her second cousin, at present a junior officer in a native infantry regiment, thereby securing the dynastic future of the firm. A sensible arrangement, Maud had thought. In all the circumstances. Even a pretty and wealthy girl these days found her choice of husband very much restricted. The war had scythed down young men in their thousands and Alice had confessed sadly that she had met no one in England she could regard as a marriage partner. So, with no regrets behind her and a favourable prospect ahead, Maud thought, it should be an easy matter to keep Alice on a straight canter down the course. Provided, naturally, that she could keep "designing women"--and she felt the description might well fit Alice's new acquaintance--at bay and fortune-hunting men at arm's length.<br><br>But Alice had left discretion behind as they had left England. Her first sight of a foreign country seemed to have turned her head. She had insisted on staying on deck on the cross-Channel ferry in spite of the stiff March breeze and had launched into conversation not only with fellow passengers but even with several of the deckhands. Instead of writing up her diary on the train to Paris she had stared about her asking a thousand questions which had brought Maud's crochet work almost to a standstill. And now they were in Paris and the mere name appeared to work some magic on Alice Conyers. Maud was glad their itinerary had allowed for no more than three days in the capital of frivolity. Alice had spent precious time patronizing the boutiques of the Rue de la Paix when she could have been visiting the Louvre. Here she was, luggage stuffed with who knew what frou-frous, bright-eyed, alert, and smiling at the world. Overexcited.<br><br>And things were getting worse. They were seated in the elaborately decorated refreshment room of the Gare de Lyon waiting for the Blue Train to be announced. Alice had sighed with pleasure and repeated the names of the towns through which it traveled on its way from Paris to the Riviera and beyond to Italy when the announcer gave them out: Lyons, Avignon, Marseilles, Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo. She leaned forward to eye the waiters in long aprons down to their ankles as they whisked about deftly delivering plates of highly seasoned and decidedly foreign-looking food to the travelers. And now her attention was entirely caught by this Frenchwoman who had settled down opposite them, sipping her dangerously sophisticated pink drink.<br><br>No better than she should be, decided Maud. Traveling alone, what's more, and that tells you something! Typical of a certain type of Frenchwoman and a totally unsuitable acquaintance for Alice. She was wearing a wedding ring on a slim white hand but that cut no ice with Maud. Her clothes were in the height of fashion and at a guess, that dark red traveling coat with its glossy black fur trimmings and matching toque were from the House of Monsieur Worth. Well, some French had profited from the war, apparently. Perhaps her husband--or protector--was in armaments, Maud thought suspiciously and wished she could convey these thoughts to Alice, but the woman spoke good English and was certain to understand. The Frenchwoman extended slender silk-clad calves and neat buttoned ankle boots. Alice tucked her own legs under the table, conscious suddenly of her lisle stockings and lace-up shoes. She turned a defiant face to Maud.<br><br>"I'm having a Campari-soda, Miss Benson. Would you like one?"<br><br>"No, I would not!"<br><br>Maud didn't like to see the look of sly complicity which this provoked between Alice and the Frenchwoman.<br><br>"Pardon me," she said. "I am Isabelle de Neuville and I'm traveling to the Cite d'Azur. And you?"<br><br>"I'm going to the south of France too but only as far as Marseilles. I'm picking up a P&amp;O steamer from Marseilles to Bombay. I'm Alice Conyers and this is my companion, Miss Benson."<br><br>Madame de Neuville acknowledged Maud with an unnecessarily friendly bow and then pointed upwards to the ceiling to one of the many florid Belle Epoque landscapes with which it was decorated. Maud had, on entering, advised Alice not to look. "Voila," she said. "That's where you're going. The painted lady represents Marseilles. The street you see is the Canebiere where all the low life and quite a lot of the high life of Marseilles is to be found. That is where your boat will leave from."<br><br>Alice followed her pointing finger, enchanted but a little scandalized by the series of opulent and semi-clad ladies who personified the cities along the route of the Blue Train. They smiled enticingly down at the travelers below, their allure only a little dimmed by almost twenty years of cigar smoke.<br><br>"And which one represents your destination?" Alice enquired.<br><br>"That one. Nice. And the street in the picture is the Promenade des Anglais."<br><br>"It looks lovely! So full of sunshine and flowers! So southern!"<br><br>"Yes, indeed. The mimosa will be over now and the magnolia and orange blossom will be out . . ."<br><br>Maud decided that this exchange should be nipped in the bud. "I observe," she said frostily, "that you are traveling without your maid?"<br><br>"Ah, no," was the reply. "My maid is handling the luggage. I hope successfully. But since the war, reliable domestic staff are hard to come by. Do you not find that?"<br><br>"Oh, I do!" said Alice. "And I had noticed that all the waiters are under sixteen or over sixty!"<br><br>"Sadly it is the same all over France and not only waiters--policemen, porters, shop assistants, engine drivers . . ."<br><br>Two things occurred at this moment to bring this rather limping conversation to a close. On the one hand, Alice's Campari-soda appeared and, on the other hand, Thomas Cook's agent appeared at Maud Benson's side.<br><br>"You have plenty of time for the moment, madam," he said, bowing politely to Maud, "but you should take your seats. If you would accompany me?"<br><br>With relief, Maud heaved herself to her feet and gestured to Alice to follow her. Isabelle de Neuville raised her glass and smiled at Alice. "To our journey," she said. "What do your English flyers say? Happy landings? Here's to happy landings!"<br><br>Alice seized the opportunity to taste her drink and annoy Maud further by not instantly leaping to her feet. Under her lowering gaze, Alice took a second sip and a third and though, truth to tell, she did not quite like the bitter aftertaste of the strange concoction, she defiantly drained her glass.<br><br>At this moment, sheepishly and with a torrent of French, Madame de Neuville's maid sidled up to her. She was dark, she was slim, she was, in Maud's opinion, unsuitably fashionably dressed for her station in life and she was, furthermore, in a shrill bad temper which she took no pains to disguise. She seemed put out to find her mistress in conversation and, after an initial look of surprise directed at Alice, she favoured her with a hostile glower. To add to Alice's embarrassment at the display and to Maud's gratification, she at once embarked on a furious and whispered quarrel with her mistress.<br><br>"There, you see!" said Maud as they followed the Cook's agent down from the peace of the Blue Train bar into the hubbub of the main station. "Now you see what will happen if you pick up with anyone who may address you. You are abroad now. This is Paris, where all the undesirables of Europe congregate. You see the kind of company you're in. Like mistress, like maid, if you ask me! Neither of them better than they should be. Maid, indeed!"<br><br>"I thought Madame de Neuville was very nice," said Alice. "And what lovely clothes!"<br><br>"Clothes! Are they paid for? And, if they are paid for, who paid for them? That is the kind of question you have to ask yourself when you take up with a stranger."<br><br>"Was she," said Alice, "do you think, a demi-mondaine?"<br><br>She wasn't entirely sure what the word meant but it had an image of risk, danger, and glamour and at that moment she very much wanted to be associated with it and dissociated from the world of Maud Benson with its careful checks and counter-balances.<br><br>"Demi-mondaine! Huh! Fully mondaine, I shouldn't wonder," sniffed Maud. "Most Frenchwomen are, you'll find. Now, come along!"<br><br>On arrival at the train they saw their luggage under the eye of the Cook's man and in the charge of porters in peaked caps and blue smocks loaded into the luggage compartment. They also saw Madame de Neuville and her maid, no longer in altercation, watching expensive luggage being loaded likewise. Alice made her way in Maud's wake, chirruping happily at the sight of the sleek and gleaming blue painted coachwork of the train, and they were handed by their agent into their reserved seats in the Pullman train under the management of the wagons-lits company. Alice was astonished by the elegance. She thought the attentive liveried stewards with their cream and umber kepis the most glamorous thing she had ever seen.</p><h2>A Range of Glaciers: The Exploration and Survey of the Northern Cascade Range</h2><p>Winner of a 2004 Washington State Book Award<br><br>In this first comprehensive account of the 19th-century exploration and survey of the northern Cascades, Fred Beckey presents a wide range of materials from dozens of archives across the United States, Canada, and beyond: voyagers&#x2019; logs, trappers&#x2019; yarns, agency and government documents, official surveys, tall tales, climbers&#x2019; journals, and sober histories. The voices, most of them from first-person narratives, range from wonder at the magnificence of the terrain, through frustration with the rigors of its harsh conditions, to the often humorous and sometimes tragic anecdotes of daily life in what was still mostly unexplored wilderness.<br><br>The story is of multiple overlays of discovery and conquest: European and American explorers and sea captains, fur traders, railroad builders, surveyors of international boundaries, settlers, gold prospectors, mountaineers, timber barons, tourists, and finally the Forest Service and National Park administrations.<br><br>Two of the narratives are recounted in detail: the story of the survey of the 49th parallel, with its clear contrast between the British and American approaches, and the account of early conquests of the major peaks, told with intimate relish by a fellow climber.<br><br>This study will be particularly appealing to those interested in American wilderness areas and the way people approached those areas during a time of dynamic change in the Pacific Northwest. At the same time, it will be a sourcebook for future histories of the northern Cascades.</p><p><b>Fred Beckey</b>, a legend among mountain climbers, is also the author of a number of climbing guides, including the three-volume <i>Cascade Alpine Guide.</i>"<i>Range of Glaciers</i> provides the needed foundation for other, less complete material on the Cascades and is long overdue.

Have you begun developing those capacities-in yourself and others?</i><p>We live in a time of vast changes that include accelerating globalization, mounting quantities of information, the growing hegemony of science and technology, and the clash of civilizations. Those changes call for new ways of learning and thinking in school, business and the professions. In<i>Five Minds for the Future</i>, noted psychologist Howard Gardner defines the cognitive abilities that will command a premium in the years ahead:</p><p></p><li>the disciplinary mind-mastery of major schools of thought (including science, mathematics, and history)and of at least one professional craft<br></li><li>the synthesizing mind-ability to integrate ideas from different disciplines or spheres into a coherent whole and to communicate that integration to others<br></li><li>the creating mind-capacity to uncover and clarify new problems, questions, and phenomena<br></li><li>the respectful mind-awareness of and appreciation for differences among human beings<br></li><li>the ethical mind-fulfillment of one's responsibilities as a worker and a citizen<p>Armed with these well-honed capacities, a person will be equipped to deal with what is expected in the future-as well as what cannot be anticipated. Without these "minds", individuals will be at the mercy of forces they can't understand-overwhelmed by information, unable to succeed in the workplace, and incapable of making judicious decisions about personal and professional manners.</p><p>Renowned worldwide for his theory of multiple intelligences, Gardner takes that thinking to the next level in this book. Concise and engaging,<i>Five Minds for the Future</i>will inspire lifelong learning in any reader and provide valuable insights for those charged with training and developing organizational leaders-today<i>and</i>tomorrow.</p></li><b>Howard Gardner</b> is the John H. and Elisabeth A.

The Invisible Man may start out slowly, but once you pay close attention, the book becomes a spine-tingling thriller that will leave you breathless. It all starts when a mysterious stranger comes into the town of Iping, all wrapped up in bandages. He never takes off his glasses, bandages, or coat, and brings all sorts of strange chemicals in little bottles with him. He sits in his hotel room all day, working with the chemicals. No one knows what he&#39;s doing, but eventually, people get suspicious. Who is this disguised man? Is he a criminal in hiding? Or maybe he&#39;s horribly disfigured! All the same, they want to get a glimpse of this strange man&#39;s face. Just imagine their surprise when they find out that this man is invisible! I would definitely inspire anyone who likes a good hard read and science-fiction to read this fantastic novel</p><p>This work is part of &#34;The Annotated H.G. Wells&#34; series from McFarland.A gripping and entertaining tale of terror and suspense as well as a potent Faustian allegory of hubris and science run amok, &#34;The Invisible Man endures as one of the signature stories in the literature of science fiction. A brilliant scientist uncovers the secret to invisibility, but his grandiose dreams and the power he unleashes cause him to spiral into intrigue, madness, and murder. The inspiration for countless imitations and film adaptations, &#34;The Invisible Man is as remarkable and relevant today as it was a hundred years ago. As Arthur C. Clarke points out in his Introduction, &#34;The interest of the story . . . lies not in its scientific concepts, but in the brilliantly worked out development of the theme of invisibility. If one could be invisible, then what?&#34;</p><h2>Bobbin Lacemaking</h2><p>Surveys the history of bobbin lacemaking and provides graded lessons incorporating a variety of simple and complex patterns</p><p></p><h2>The Spy Who Stayed Out in the Cold: The Secret Life of FBI Double Agent Robert Hanssen</h2><p>Robert Philip Hansen thought he was smarter than the system. For decades, the quirky but respected counterintelligence expert, religious family man, and father of six, sold top secret information to agents of the Soviet Union and Russia. A self-taught computer expert, Hansen often encrypted his stolen files on wafer-thin disks. The data-some 6000 pages of highly classified documents-revealed precious nuclear secrets, outlined American espionage initiatives, and named names of agents-spies who covertly worked for both sides. <br><br>Soviet government leaders, and their successors in the Russian Federation, used the stolen information to undermine U.S. policies and to eliminate spies in their own ranks. Moscow did not allow their moles the luxury of a defense: at least two men named by Hanssen were executed; a third languished for years in a Siberian hard labor camp.<br><br>For more than twenty years, Bob Hanssen was the perfect spy. He personally collected at least $600,000 from his Russian handlers while another $800,000 was deposited in his name at a Moscow bank. Along with the cash came Rolex watches and cut diamonds. The money financed both his children's education at schools run by the elite and ultra-conservative Catholic organization, Opus Dei, and an inexplicably strange fling with a former Ohio "stripper of the year." <br><br>But he didn't just do it for the money; he did it for the thrill and for a mysterious third reason rooted in religious mysticism. He lacked the people skills to play office politics, and it seemed the aging FBI analyst faced a disappointing career mired in middle management. Instead, he chose to become one of the most dangerous spies in America's history. And no one suspected him until just weeks before his arrest.<br><br>Robert Philip Hanssen thought he was smarter than the system. And until February 18, 2001, he was right. That's when federal agents surrounded him while he was attempting to complete an exchange with his handlers at a Virginia park. When the G-men captured their mark, they catapulted the once innocuous bureaucrat onto the front pages of every newspaper in America. The most notorious spy since the Rosenbergs had finally become a victim of his own undoing.<br><br>Now, drawing on more than 100 interviews with Bob Hanssen's friends, colleagues, coworkers, and family members, and confidential sources, best-selling author Adrian Havill tells the entire story you haven't read as only he can. <i>The Spy Who Stayed Out in the Cold</i> tells not only how he did it, but why. <br></p><p>While the term <i>double agent</i> implies contradiction, Adrian Havill's portrait of spymaster Robert Hanssen reveals a man truly driven by opposing demons. Hanssen was a consummate loner, "Walter Mitty squared," yet he approached the Soviets himself in quest of the thrill-filled life of a double agent. A staunch conservative and strict Catholic, he took money from communists--to give diamonds and Mercedes to strippers on one hand, and to send his six children to expensive Catholic schools on the other. Havill, a seasoned chronicler of criminals and celebrities, creates a taut and troubling portrait of a disturbed man who compromised the security of a nation. He also gives an inside look into the oft-inept FBI, the National Security Agency's futuristic surveillance systems, and the spy-versus-spy world of Russian intelligence. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>Adrian Havill is the author of <i>While Innocents Slept</i> and <i>The Mother, The Son, And the Socialite: The True Story of a Mother-Son Crime</i>.

With profound compassion, Berger explores the hearts and minds of both men and women, and what happens during sex, to reveal the conditions of the libertine&#39;s success: his essential loneliness, the quiet cumulation in each of his sexual experiences of all of those that precede it, the tenderness that infuses even the briefest of his encounters, and the way women experience their own extraordinariness through their liaisons with him. Set against the turbulent backdrop of Garibaldi&#39;s attempt to unite Italy, the failed revolution of Milanese workers in 1898, the Boer War and the dramatic first flight across the Alps, G. is a brilliant novel about the search for intimacy in the turmoil of history.</p><p>John Berger was born in London in 1926.

In the course of her search for the nocturnal animal, she captures a cat, creates a creature, unearths a mummy, assembles a skeleton, and conjures a haunt. At the somewhat anticlimactic ending, readers discover why she wants the bat-for "Nothing more/than to adorn/her Halloween hat!" A lively refrain invites participation: "I know why/she wanted the bat./But I won't tell you that." The watercolor and pen-and-ink pictures are more fun than fierce and include a lot of color and humor, but the crowded design of many of the pages, as well as the illustrator's style of showing partial figures, make the book problematic for group use.

The book examines Iran, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Jordan and the Middle East. It argues that there is feminism amongst Islamic women, and reveals other startling discoveries that defy western stereotypes about the Muslin world. This study offers an acute analysis of the world&#39;s fastest growing religion, and illustrates how Islam&#39;s holy texts have been used to justify the repression of women.</p><p>Geraldine Brooks spent two years as a Middle East news correspondent, covering the death of Khomeini and the like. She also learned a lot about what it&#39;s like for Islamic women today. Brooks&#39; book is exceedingly well-done--she knows her Islamic lore and traces the origins of today&#39;s practices back to Mohammed&#39;s time. Personable and very readable, Brooks takes us through the women&#39;s back door entrance of the Middle East for an unusual and provocative view.This, my first book, was published back in 1994. &nbsp;I wish I could say that change and progress in the lives of the women I lived among and wrote about has made the book outdated. &nbsp;Sadly, that is not the case. &nbsp;The insights I shared are still depressingly relevant and our need to understand even more pressing.</p><h2>Dinosaurs in Space (Balloon Toons)</h2><p>Dinosaurs and Life in Space&#x2013;c'mon, what could be a funnier combination?

He will be forging further adventures for both the Dinosaurs in Space and the intrepid BBK. The author lives in Chicago, Illinos.K-Gr 2-Humorous tones abound as beginning readers discover the secret about what really happened to dinosaurs. Apparently, they traveled into outer space and settled on Planet Lettuce and Planet Meatball. These names are obvious references to carnivores and herbivores that fans of dinosaurs will recall. These creatures from differing planets do not like one another and disagreements and battles ensue regarding who is better: those who eat salads or those who eat hamburgers. Bubbled text with whimsical illustrations provide context for early readers. The balanced layout brings both to a level that emerging readers and younger fans of Dav Pilkey's "Captain Underpants" series (Scholastic) will enjoy.

He gets caught up with&nbsp;questions of travel, noting his reaction to the idea of leaving or arriving, to hurry&nbsp;and delay, what it means to dread a place you&#x2019;ve never been to or to encounter the&nbsp;actuality of a long-held vision. He is sensitive to the emotional landscape of his band&nbsp;of travelers and, above all, continuously analyzing and fixing this &#x201c;most romantic&nbsp;of all deserts.&#x201d;<br><br> Lavinia Greenlaw follows in his footsteps, and interposes his prose with her own&nbsp;&#x201c;questions of travel.&#x201d; The result is a new and composite work that brilliantly&nbsp;explores our conflicted reasons for not staying at home.</p><p><b>William Morris </b>(1834&#x2013;1896) was the foremost English designer of his time, a&nbsp;polemicist and reformer, poet and traveler. He is regarded as one of the myriadminded&nbsp;giants of the nineteenth century, and his graphic and wallpaper designs are&nbsp;still highly popular today.<br><br> <b>Lavinia Greenlaw </b>is a poet, novelist, documentary filmmaker, and BBC broadcaster.&nbsp;She studied seventeenth-century art at the Courtauld Institute of Art and was awarded&nbsp;a three-year NESTA Fellowship to pursue her interest in vision, travel, and perception.&nbsp;Her poetry includes <i>Minsk </i>and <i>The Casual Perfect</i>. She is also the author&nbsp;of two novels, <i>Mary George of Allnorthover </i>and <i>An Irresponsible Age: Thoughts of a</i>&nbsp;<i>Night Sea </i>(in collaboration with Gerry Fabian Miller), and the nonfiction book <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Importance of Music to Girls</i>. She is a professor of creative writing at the University&nbsp;of East Anglia.&#x201c;What an original and haunting book! William Morris&#x2019;s account of his journey through Iceland is touching, quick, vivid, often very funny, while Lavinia Greenlaw&#x2019;s spare commentary acts as a kind of brilliant x-ray into the deep structures of travel itself. Combined, they form a work of strange and rare enchantment.&#x201d; &#x2014;James Lasdun<br><br>&#x201c;Morris&#x2019;s journals...are precious and unique because they are so simply and beautifully written with the informed sense of wonder of a deeply learned and sophisticated man. No one except Ruskin has ever put the case for beauty with such vehemence and clarity.&#x201d; &#x2014;Ian McQueen, <i>The Guardian</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;At a time of endless half-truths and moral shilly-shallying, Morris&#x2019;s eccentric integrity shines out.&#x201d; &#x2014;Fiona MacCarthy <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Greenlaw has brilliantly found a new form for writing about Morris, and for this we can only be grateful.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tony Pinkney, <i>William Morris Unbound Blog</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The best book of travel written by an English poet is William Morris&#x2019;s <i>Icelandic Journal</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;Geoffrey Grigson</p><h2>Gregory of Nyssa: Sermons on the Beatitudes (Classics in Spiritual Formation)</h2><p>As part of the Classics in Spiritual Formation, the sermons of Gregory of Nyssa offer a contemporary rendering of ancient spiritual wisdom for today&#39;s readers.

You&#39;ll also find helpful callouts that show how the work relates to your personal spiritual formation and clarify unfamiliar ideas.

He continues his research in the history of exegesis as the director of the Early African Christianity Projects and as the executive director of the Center for Early African Christianity at Eastern University."Many Christians in history embraced treasured ideas that we today easily miss. Gregory of Nyssa thought these 'big thoughts,' and Michael Glerup helps us embrace them, too." (Jan Johnson, author of Abundant Simplicity)<br><br>"A paraphrase is tricky business. Too much freedom leads to the loss of the original text's meaning. Too little freedom fails to build a bridge into the world of a modern reader. Michael Glerup's paraphrase avoids these dangers and warmly welcomes modern North Americans into the active mind and lively heart of one of the great church fathers." (Christopher A. Hall, chancellor, Eastern University)<br><br>"This book was a delight to read! I felt like Gregory of Nyssa was right here in my own sanctuary, preaching to me. Dr. Glerup's wonderful paraphrase has St. Gregory speaking of hedge-fund managers, supermodels, Ponzi schemes, and more as he opens the Beatitudes for us. The introduction and the sidebars provided valuable background and suggestions for application. The discussion questions helped me to review, consider, and live what I had read. But more than simply the form of this book, I delighted in its message, an attractive invitation to enjoy the blessed riches that are available to those who follow the way of Christ." (Evan B. Howard, director of Spirituality Shoppe, author of The Brazos Introduction to Christian Spirituality)<br><br>"I am a great fan of the church of the first four centuries--the church known by the outside culture for how it loved well. Michael Glerup is a trusted scholar who knows how to mine the wisdom and practices of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the early church to make these treasures accessible for twenty-first-century Christians." (Gary W. Moon, M.Div., Ph.D., executive director, Dallas Willard Center at Westmont College)<br><br>"Michael Glerup has devoted himself to making accessible the riches of the early Christian writers, and this thin volume continues this life work. The informative introduction sets us up to thoughtfully appreciate this attractive and readable translation of a remarkable church leader, theologian and spiritual writer." (James C.

He worked a wide variety of jobs--including TV cameraman, radio commentator, oyster diver, jungle survival instructor, lay analyst, creative writing teacher, reporter and editor of several West Coast newspapers--before becoming a full-time writer. He died in 1986.After three fine collections celebrating SF greats Arthur C. Clarke, Fritz Leiber and Philip Jose Farmer, Preiss's Masterworks of SF &amp; Fantasy series hits a snag here. Herbert is one of the biggest names in the field but his best work has been of novel length (Dune, Hellstrom's Hive, etc.). While some of the themes of those books reappear here, the stories are generally mediocre because Herbert lacks the space for adequate background and characterization to make us care. Only the short "Seed Stock," about colonizing an alien world, delves beneath the plot mechanics. This collection might have been redeemed if, like the previous volumes, it had included a long autobiographical essay. In its place, however, is a short, weak defense of the movie version of Dune.

Cantrell, Ramsey Campbell, John Coyne, Lawrence Block, Jonathan Carroll, Ed Gorman, and Charles L. Grant</p><p>Companion to last year's Psycho-Paths horror anthology, edited as before by the renowned motherstuffer of Psycho. Bloch's editorial chutzpa has collected some top-flight genre writers for this sheaf--most of which is not bad at all and some of which is quite well written. All told, the 17 authors know they're in good company and strive for excellence, though generally the stories featuring thuggish protagonists sink to the dreariest predictability--a thought that means the more intelligent the protagonist, the better the writing. Bloch kicks off with the best- written piece here, ``Snow Man'' by John Coyne, about a bitter Peace Corps teacher in Ethiopia whose students decide to teach him a lesson. Ray Bradbury's genial ``Fee Fie Fo Fum'' tells about the new bone-grinding Garburator in the kitchen sink and features the best opening sentence in the collection: ``The postman came melting along the sidewalk in the hot summer sun, his nose dripping, his fingers wet on his full leather pouch.'' Ramsey Campbell's ``For You To Judge'' tells of a juror on a serial-murder case who takes on the character of the guilty man. Jonathan Carroll's ``The Lick of Time'' finds a young woman being taken over by her own voice on her new high-tech answering machine. Charles L. Grant's ``Name That Tune'' Features a hopeful random-killer-to-be haunted by a tune whose name he can't remember until he's mugged in an alley. In ``It Takes One To Know One,'' editor Bloch cuts rather close to the bone, drawing a group of hack horror writers from the Fifties who form The Skull Club and set up a tontine: the last of them to remain alive wins a 98-cent bottle of Chianti. Though a mechanical revenge story, it's more carefully written than Bloch's embarrassing intro to the volume. Better than you may expect but not memorable. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The author of Psycho , which spawned a legion of homicidal maniacs in modern horror fiction, returns as an anthologist with a sequel to last year's Psycho-Paths . Once again inviting some of the field's finest writers to explore the subject of deranged evil, Bloch has elicited 17 terrifying, brilliantly conceived characters, each one disturbingly credible and original. Among the most memorable: an ungrateful grandson-in-law whose chosen weapon is a garbage disposal in Ray Bradbury's darkly humorous "Fee Fie Fo Fum"; a gas station attendant and frustrated inventor whose homemade gasoline additive makes for cleaner air and countless mysterious deaths in Robert E. Vardeman's "A Gentle Breeze Blowing"; an overzealous animal rights activist in Lawrence Block's "How Would You Like It?"; and a neurotic young actress who feels she doesn't get enough messages on her answering machine in "The Lick of Time" by Jonathan Carroll. As Bloch promises in his introduction, the selections consistently explore--with chilling success--"the why , as well as the way" psychopaths operate, adeptly mapping the fine line between human and inhuman, sane and insane. As unsettling as they are entertaining, many of these forays into the psyche's dark side are sure to become classics. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Strike Art: Contemporary Art and the Post-Occupy Condition</h2><p><b>The collision of activism and contemporary art, from the Seattle protests to Occupy and beyond</b><br><br> The collision of activism and contemporary art, from the Seattle protests to Occupy and beyond What is the relation of art to the practice of radical politics today? Strike Art explores this question through the historical lens of Occupy, an event that had artists at its core. Precarious, indebted, and radicalized, artists redirected their creativity from servicing the artworld into an expanded field of organizing in order to construct of a new&#x2014;if internally fraught&#x2014;political imaginary set off against the common enemy of the 1%.

McKee&#x2019;s book is therefore replete with granular information about the ambitious, and sometimes ambiguous, revolt of the 99%, details that other commentators can only address in a second-hand manner. In this sense he aligns his writing with Walter Benjamin&#x2019;s well-known directive that authors become producers with a &#x2018;tendentious&#x2019; tilt towards working class struggles.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>E-flux</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Because he is both committed to what he recounts but also nuanced in his criticisms, McKee&#x2019;s book is one of the most coherent presentations of the new kinds of activist art that we have seen emerge since the development of social media and by and large after the emergence of the alterglobalization Left in the late 1990s.&#x201d;<br><b> &#x2014;<i>Marx and Philosophy</i></b></p><h2>A Rogue in Texas (Rogues in Texas, 1)</h2><p><p>He was the wrong man for the job in every way but one . . .</p><p>Grayson Rhodes, the illegitimate son of a duke, heads to America to prove his worth and earn his fortune.

Although he's surprised to learn that their leader's get-rich scheme involves hiring them out as Texas cotton field workers to replace men lost in the Civil War, Grayson is determined to succeed. Assigned to widow Abbie Westland's homestead, it isn't long before Grayson is as attracted to her strength and beauty as he is to the Texas landscape. The hard manual labor makes Grayson stronger but he soon loses his heart to the widow and her lovable children. However, Abbie's past haunts her and threatens the hope of a happy future with Grayson.</p><p> <i>A Rogue in Texas</i> is rich in memorable characters, with a hero who is strong enough to survive and thrive in a new world and a heroine who finds in her man a depth of love she was unaware existed. The Texas landscape and 1860s farm life come alive in vibrant colors. Just when you think the ending is a foregone conclusion, Heath surprises you with a new twist in the plot, making this a historical treat on many levels. <i>--Lois Faye Dyer</i></p><p>Lorraine Heath always dreamed&nbsp;of being a writer. After graduating from the University of Texas, she wrote training manuals, press releases, articles, and computer code, but something was always missing. When she read a romance novel, she not only became hooked on the genre, but quickly realized what her writing lacked: rebels, scoundrels, and rogues. She&#x2019;s been writing about them ever since.

The reader is led through the adventure by Miss Fanshawe&#39;s parrot who gives clues on how to manipulate the book. Relates how the intrepid explorer, Miss Harriet Fanshawe, discovers a dragon and her egg in distant Patagonia and brings them back to England</p><p>Miss Harriet Fanshawe, the great explorer, has heard about the center of the Earth and the fiery dragons' breath that keep its fires aflame. While on expedition in Patagonia, she spots a dragon's nest high up in the mountain. Her only company is Cedric the parrot, her constant companion. Miss Fanshawe carries the dragon's egg in her butterfly net and lassoes the dragon to take back to England. There he's put in a cage for everyone to see. A sinister bird appears, carries off the egg and flies away to a distant crater where it vanishes into its darkness. Miss Fanshawe follows along, in an odyssey to the center of the Earth; this proves to be nothing short of apocalyptic. She faces a black leopard, and passes through a monumental corridor of hieroglyphical columns with infinite extensions, where all sense of time and perspective is lost. With the help of the dragon she saves, Miss Fanshawe reverses her journey back to the world of light. Scullard's Herculean effort to transfigure this grand vision into an illustrated book for children has met with success. Unquestionably, this is one of the most stunning adventures of the year. The cupola of the Magnificent City is cut-out on one page, showing the content of the following spread; this technique is used more than once, with surprising results. Not unlike Cedric the parrot, readers may feel that they too were aboard, traveling from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high.

Many of the plants used for herbal medicine around Pompeii today are the same ones that ancient authorities such as Pliny the Elder and Dioscorides recommended for treating the same types of disorders. </p><p> In this book, Jashemski presents an herbal of thirty-six medicinal plants, most of them known to the ancients and still employed today. She describes each plant's contemporary medicinal uses and compares them to ancient practices as recorded in literary sources. Scientific, English, and Italian names and the plant's mythological associations complete the entries, while elegant, full-page portraits depict each plant visually. </p></p><p>Wilhelmina Feemster Jashemski was Professor of Ancient History at the University of Maryland.&#34;The appeal of such a work will be wide, encompassing professionals and laymen alike. The book is the type which a visitor to Pompeii, or to Italy generally, would want to take along as a vade mecum [guidebook].&#34; (Robert I.

The bulk of the material comes from "The Elvis Cover-Up," an hour-long program the authors produced, along with Geraldo Rivera, for ABC's 20/20 in 1979. Since that program and a subsequent follow-up report aired, Thompson and Cole have gained possession of secret autopsy records that unhesitatingly establish the cause of Elvis's death as multiple drug ingestion, not the hypertensive heart disease officially reported by the Shelby County Medical Examiner. Interviews with the Memphis Mafia, toxicologists, pathologists, and lawyers reveal a drug-dependent Elvis for whom 12,000 pills--uppers, downers, amphetamines, and pain killers used by terminally ill cancer patients--were prescribed in the last 20 months of his life. Idolatrous Elvis fans will read anything on him--but they should read this. Previewed in Prepub Alert, LJ 9/15/90.<br><i>- Barry Miller, Austin P.L., Tex.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Thompson, a producer at 60 Minutes , and newsman/editor Cole attempt to clear up the mystery of Elvis Presley's death in 1977 by showing that the real cause was not, as others have proposed, heart attack, cancer, suicide or murder but an accidental overdose of multiple drugs, including codeine, to which the King was allergic. They purportedly spent a decade investigating all aspects of his pathetic last years--marked by depression and inability to cope with reality, by difficult relationships with women and sleazy associates who fawned on him and later cashed in on his death, by addiction to medical drugs and reliance on a doctor who fostered this drug dependency. Every grisly detail of his final hours is examined, as well as the autopsy that followed. Fans hungry for gory particulars about Elvis's death may be morbidly fascinated, but most readers will find this report extremely disagreeable.

The de la Torres escaped, but Luis' family did not. Luis eventually left Cuba by raft and is now trying to reclaim the family share of the money from the de la Torres, who have become among the most prominent of Miami families. After he is nearly murdered, Luis uses a diamond his parents gave him to hire Lupe and attorney Tommy McDonald, Lupe's occasional boyfriend, to recover the money. This third Lupe Solano novel is uneven but not without interest. The dialogue is lively; the intriguing and amusing characters are well developed; and Garcia-Aguilera does a good job of educating readers about recent Cuban history. Unfortunately, the mystery element is weak, a flaw throughout the series. Still, Lupe is unique among Miami sleuths, and as a whole, the series' strengths outweigh its weaknesses. <i>John Rowen</i>Despite the tacit disapproval of her body- and health-conscious cousin and co-worker, Cuban American investigator Lupe Solano, last seen in Bloody Shame (LJ 2/1/97), takes a case involving a raft refugee from Cuba. Aristocratic Luis Delgado's long-dead parents sent part of their wealth to Miami with friends when Castro took over, but when Luis claims the money, the now-prominent "friends" try to erase the debt by hiring a hit man. Lupe treads carefully, both because of the family's influence and because she finds her client attractive. Lupe's energetic lifestyle, her fascinating friends, and the author's fluid segues make this an essential purchase.<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bonner&#39;s Stallion</h2><p>Bonner faces losing his mistress, his son, and his mountain ranch to a rich and powerful enemy, until the feared and hated rogue stallion, El Diablo Rojo, turns up once again and convinces Bonner he can win.

Lee ordered Maj. Gen. James Longstreet to conduct a reconnaissance and possible assault on the Chinn Ridge front in Northern Virginia. At the time Longstreet launched his attack, only a handful of Union troops stood between Robert E. Lee and Gen. John Pope&#x2019;s Army of Virginia. Northern Virginia&#x2019;s rolling terrain and Bull Run also provided Lee with a unique opportunity seldom seen during the entire Civil War&#x2014;that of "bagging" an army, an elusive feat keenly desired by political leaders of both sides. <i>Second Manassas: Longstreet&#x2019;s Attack and the Struggle for Chinn Ridge</i> details the story of Longstreet and his men&#x2019;s efforts to obtain the ultimate victory that Lee desperately sought. At the same time, this account tells of the Union soldiers who, despite poor leadership and lack of support from Pope and his senior officers, bravely battled Longstreet and saved their army from destruction along the banks of Bull Run. Longstreet&#x2019;s men were able to push the Union forces back, but only after they had purchased enough time for the Union army to retreat in good order. Although Lee did not achieve a decisive victory, his success at Chinn Ridge allowed him to carry the war north of the Potomac River, thus setting the stage for his Maryland Campaign. Within three weeks, the armies would meet again along the banks of Antietam Creek in western Maryland. Uncovering new sources, Scott Patchan gives a vivid picture of the battleground and a fresh perspective that sharpens the detail and removes the guesswork found in previous works dealing with the climactic clash at Second Manassas.</p><p>Scott C. Patchan, a veteran Civil War battlefield guide and historian, is the author of <i>Shenandoah Summer: The 1864 Valley Campaign (2009)</i> and <i>The Forgotten Fury: The Battle of Piedmont, Virginia (1996)</i>. He also served as a research consultant and contributing writer for Time-Life&#x2019;s <i>Voices of the Civil War: Shenandoah, 1864 (1998)</i>. Mr. Patchan has twice served as president of the Bull Run Civil War Round Table and is a much sought after tour guide for both Revolutionary and Civil War battlefields and historic sites. He resides in Northern Virginia."On the afternoon of August 30, 1862, Robert E. Lee glimpsed an opportunity to destroy a Union army on the field of battle. Much is known about how James Longstreet&#x2019;s men rolled over a gallant brigade of New York Zouaves and headed for the Union rear. What happened next is the subject of Scott Patchan&#x2019;s fine study, based on an intimate familiarity with the sources and the ground over which men fought and died.

" Brando's evaluation of his acting and that of other celebrated actors, e.g., Olivier in <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, mark this rumination on his life. In his analysis of his films, from <i>Streetcar</i> to <i>The Freshman</i>, the master tries hard to demonstrate hubris and to provide public lessons. At the same time, he claims that luck, physical desires, and the need to make money motivate him. The book, which the publisher would not release in galleys, strikes the reader as a confession, an attempt to set the record straight, to circumvent "a carrion press that has an insatiable appetite for salaciousness and abhors being denied access to anyone, from pimps to presidents." Is it coincidence that Manso's unauthorized <i>Brando</i> and this book are being published a month apart? Whatever its raison d'{&#x2c6;}etre, <i>Songs My Mother Taught Me</i> has much to offer. First, it's beautifully illustrated, beginning before the text with 24 pages of photographs covering Brando's early life, continuing with a number of well-placed photos documenting various film shoots, and concluding with 32 pages of photographs near the end. Brando's account of his early years rings true as he records the frailties of his alcoholic parents. His anecdotes about work and play are entertaining and memorable, and he addresses the many social causes he has championed. It's an interesting, albeit incomplete, work: according to coauthor Lindsey, Brando promised to "hide nothing . . . except his marriages and his children." (So many marriages, so many children.) Readers of Manso can't come here to find Brando's side of his marital troubles or the perplexing murder of his daughter's husband at the hands of his son. But they will find insight into the life of a man who was definitely a contender. <i>Bonnie Smothers</i>The publisher reportedly paid $5 million for this book but expects to recoup its investment; after all, this will be the only Brando autobiography available. Lindsey, who authored the prize-winning The Falcon and the Snowman, also helped Ronald Reagan when he faced writer's block over his autobiography.

A lone hero in search of salvation and finding, instead, destiny. The Dark Prince - the child who will become Alexander, creator of the greatest empire the world has ever known. He will conquer all. All except the Chaos Spirit, the immortal evil that dwells in his soul. Together they will be forced into other dimensions, across time, into enchanted worlds full of wonder and sorcery...</p><p>Reading this sequel to <i>Lion of Macedon</i> is like reading a compressed, accelerated <i>Lord of the Rings</i> crossed with the classic <i>Star Trek</i> episode, "Mirror, Mirror." Preternaturally precocious 4-year-old Alexander is kidnapped by Philippos, a demonic parallel-universe twin of King Philip of Macedon. Philip's strategos (chief general and strategist), Parmenion, and Philip's assassin, Attalus, form an uneasy alliance in order to retrieve Alexander. Passed (by the sorcerer Aristotle) through a portal to Makedones, a world geographically similar to but historically different from their own, they must first find Alexander and then make their way through hostile, enchanted territory inhabited by magical creatures to a rendezvous with Aristotle. But Philip of Macedon isn't the only person who has a twin in this parallel world, and as Parmenion discovers more about Makedones, he finds that the similarities rather than the differences are the most troubling. <p> There are two stories here. First, Alexander's mystic quest for redemption (carried out by the chosen few) and Parmenion and the Spartans' parallel last-ditch battle (fought with ordinary weapons); then, David Gemmell follows Alexander and Parmenion home. Although they have beaten a horrific demon in Makedones, they have yet to face the demons of Macedon: Alexander's life and soul are at stake in another battle against darkness.</p>The chaos spirit had chosen the child Alexander to be its human host. But Parmenion, most powerful warrior of ancient Greece, had won a small victory over the darkness that sought to rule through Alexander. The boy's soul had not been destroyed by evil, but instead had merged with it -- and now Parmenion aided Alexander in the battle between light and dark that constantly raged within him.<br>But there was another world, where the creatures of Greece's legends still flourished. There, the chaos spirit already ruled, through a demon king. In this Greece, there was a prophecy that a child of great power, the legendary golden child, would come and restore the fading magic of the land to the creatures of myth. The demon king believed also that devouring the heart of this fabled child would give him immortality. He believed Alexander, with the power of the chaos spirit within him, to be that child. And so he called Alexander into his world . . .<br>Only Parmenion, guided by the seeress Derae, his lost love from another life, could hope to save Alexander from the demon king. But who could save the young prince from the chaos spirit that threatened to conquer his soul?</p><h2>Arthur&#39;s funny money (An I can read book)</h2><p>When Violet has a numbers problem and Arthur is penniless, they go into business and solve both problems.</p><p><p>Lillian Hoban was the author and illustrator of many favorite I Can Read books, including <em>Joe and Betsy the Dinosaur</em>, <em>Silly Tilly's Thanksgiving</em>, and a series about Arthur the Chimpanzee.

The girls are fiercely loyal to their Handlers and would do anything to protect them.</p><p>Grade 10 Up&#x2013;Containing the artful blend of action and melodrama common to many popular manga series, <i>Gunslinger Girl</i> tells the stories of little-girl assassins trained by an undercover arm of the Italian government. Their bodies are improved with prosthetics and rigorous training, while their minds are conditioned so that childish emotions and needs do not interfere with their work. However, the agency has not completely succeeded in stamping out the children's humanity, or that of their adult handlers. At one point, a slight, fair child cheerily asks for ice cream as her reward for carrying out a gruesome attack; at another a group of handlers are distressed to find that a newly conditioned recruit has forgotten a fairy tale they used to tell her. Drawn in a more spare, sober style than other manga thrillers, this is an unusually provocative tale that should keep its readers thinking as they wait for the next installment.<i>&#x2013;Lisa Goldstein, Brooklyn Public Library, NY</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I have always been an optimistic woman, but time has left me bitter, alone, and sad.<br><br>If things turn out as I hope, you will never receive this letter. I&#x2019;ll have been pardoned. After all, I spent my life cultivating influential friends. I will hold on to the letter so that, one day, my only daughter might read it to find out who her mother was.<br><br>But if I am wrong, I have little hope that these pages, which have consumed my last week of life on Earth, will be kept. I have always been a realistic woman and I know that, once a case is settled, a lawyer will move on to the next one without a backward glance.<br><br>I can imagine what will happen after. You will be a very busy man, having gained notoriety defending a war criminal. You will have many people knocking at your door, begging for your services, for, even defeated, you attracted huge publicity. You will meet journalists interested to hear your version of events, you will dine in the city&#x2019;s most expensive restaurants, and you will be looked upon with respect and envy by your peers. You will know there was never any concrete evidence against me&#x2014;only documents that had been tampered with&#x2014;but you will never publicly admit that you allowed an innocent woman to die.<br><br>Innocent? Perhaps that is not the right word. I was never innocent, not since I first set foot in this city I love so dearly. I thought I could manipulate those who wanted state secrets. I thought the Germans, French, English, Spanish would never be able to resist me&#x2014;and yet, in the end, I was the one manipulated. The crimes I did commit, I escaped, the greatest of which was being an emancipated and independent woman in a world ruled by men. I was convicted of espionage even though the only thing concrete I traded was the gossip from high-society salons.<br><br>Yes, I turned this gossip into &#x201c;secrets,&#x201d; because I wanted money and power. But all those who accuse me now know I never revealed anything new.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a shame no one will know this. These envelopes will inevitably find their way to a dusty file cabinet, full of documents from other proceedings. Perhaps they will leave when your successor, or your successor&#x2019;s successor, decides to make room and throw out old cases.<br><br>By that time, my name will have been long forgotten. But I am not writing to be remembered. I am attempting to understand things myself. Why? How is it that a woman who for so many years got everything she wanted can be condemned to death for so little?<br><br>At this moment, I look back at my life and realize that memory is a river, one that always runs backward.<br><br>Memories are full of caprice, where images of things we&#x2019;ve experienced are still capable of suffocating us through one small detail or insignificant sound. The smell of baking bread wafts up to my cell and reminds me of the days I walked freely in the caf�s. This tears me apart more than my fear of death or the solitude in which I now find myself.<br><br>Memories bring with them a devil called melancholy&#x2014;oh, cruel demon that I cannot escape. Hearing a prisoner singing, receiving a small handful of letters from admirers who were never among those who brought me roses and jasmine flowers, picturing a scene from some city I didn&#x2019;t appreciate at the time. Now it&#x2019;s all I have left of this or that country I visited.<br><br>The memories always win, and with them comes a demon that is even more terrifying than melancholy: remorse. It&#x2019;s my only companion in this cell, except when the sisters decide to come and chat. They do not speak about God, or condemn me for what society calls my &#x201c;sins of the flesh.&#x201d; Generally, they say one or two words, and the memories spout from my mouth, as if I wanted to go back in time, plunging into this river that runs backward.<br><br>One of them asked me:<br><br>&#x201c;If God gave you a second chance, would you do anything differently?&#x201d;<br><br>I said yes, but really, I do not know. All I know is that my current heart is a ghost town, one populated by passions, enthusiasm, loneliness, shame, pride, betrayal, and sadness. I cannot disentangle myself from any of it, even when I feel sorry for myself and weep in silence.<br><br>I am a woman who was born at the wrong time and nothing can be done to fix this. I don&#x2019;t know if the future will remember me, but if it does, may it never see me as a victim, but as someone who moved forward with courage, fearlessly paying the price she had to pay.</p><h2>Brancusi</h2><p>A definitive book on the work of Constantin Brancusi, featuring one of the most complete collections of Brancusi's work in one volume.

During World War II he was captured following service in North Africa and Italy, and his prisoner-of-war experiences later leading to the writing of the acclaimed novel &#39;Death in Captivity&#39; in 1952.After the war, Gilbert worked as a solicitor in London, but his writing continued throughout his legal career and in addition to novels he wrote stage plays and scripts for radio and television. He is, however, best remembered for his novels, which have been described as witty and meticulously-plotted espionage and police procedural thrillers, but which exemplify realism.HRF Keating stated that &#39;Smallbone Deceased&#39; was amongst the 100 best crime and mystery books ever published. &#34;The plot,&#34; wrote Keating, &#34;is in every way as good as those of Agatha Christie at her best: as neatly dovetailed, as inherently complex yet retaining a decent credibility, and as full of cunningly-suggested red herrings.&#34; It featured Chief Inspector Hazlerigg, who went on to appear in later novels and short stories, and another series was built around Patrick Petrella, a London based police constable (later promoted) who was fluent in four languages and had a love for both poetry and fine wine. Other memorable characters around which Gilbert built stories included Calder and Behrens. They are elderly but quite amiable agents, who are nonetheless ruthless and prepared to take on tasks too much at the dirty end of the business for their younger colleagues. They are brought out of retirement periodically upon receiving a bank statement containing a code.Much of Michael Gilbert&#39;s writing was done on the train as he travelled from home to his office in London: &#34;I always take a latish train to work,&#34; he explained in 1980, &#34;and, of course, I go first class. I have no trouble in writing because I prepare a thorough synopsis beforehand.&#34;. After retirement from the law, however, he nevertheless continued and also reviewed for &#39;The Daily Telegraph&#39;, as well as editing &#39;The Oxford Book of Legal Anecdotes&#39;.Gilbert was appointed CBE in 1980. Generally regarded as &#39;one of the elder statesmen of the British crime writing fraternity, he was a founder-member of the British Crime Writers&#39; Association and in 1988 he was named a Grand Master by the Myst"Exciting yarn with ingenious wrinkles about art smuggling and disposal, done in a quietly comic, very cool Waugh-ish mode."

Or does active evangelism imply that God is not really sovereign at all?</p><p>The mystery and seeming paradox between evangelism and God's sovereignty has been causing disagreements and confusion among Christians since the beginning of the 20th century. In <i>Evangelism &amp; the Sovereignty of God</i>, J.I. Packer reveals that a faulty understanding of the Bible leads to the assessment that these doctrines are foes rather than friends. By debunking the erroneous view that "robust faith in the absolute sovereignty of God is bound to undermine any adequate sense of human responsibility" toward evangelism, the author adeptly moves through the obstacle course of tricky theology with ease and grace, allowing the reader a more complete understanding of the mystery of salvation. Packer manages to tackle an overwhelming piece of doctrinal truth and contain it within the subject of evangelism by concisely determining what evangelism is and what it is not. "It is our widespread and persistent habit of defining evangelism in terms, not of a message delivered, but of an effect produced in our hearers." This error is corrected when one is renewed in his or her knowledge of the sovereignty of God. Of course, fault is found on the other side as well, with those who so heavily rely on God's sovereignty to save the lost that they are lazy in obeying God's command to share the Gospel. Packer insists that love for God, at the very least, should draw one out of this stagnation and that the coupling of these seemingly diabolical doctrines will make one bold in speech, patient in God's timing, and prayerful for the salvation of others. <i>--Jill Heatherly</i>J. I. Packer is Board of Governors Professor of Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia. He also serves as contributing editor to Christianity Today. Packer's writings include books such as Knowing God (IVP Books), A Quest for Godliness (Crossway), Growing in Christ (Crossway) and Rediscovering Holiness (Servant), and numerous articles published in journals such as Churchman, SouthWestern Journal, Christianity Today, Reformation &amp; Revival Journal and Touchstone.</p><h2>Mop Men: Inside the World of Crime Scene Cleaners</h2><p><br><br>Neal Smither doesn&#x2019;t hide his work. The side of his van reads: &#x201c;Crime Scene Cleaners: Homicides, Suicides and Accidental Death.&#x201d; Whenever a hotel guest permanently checks out, the cops finish an investigation, or an accidental death is reported, Smither&#x2019;s crew pick up the pieces after the police cruisers and ambulances have left. <p></p>Alan Emmins offers a glimpse at this little-known aspect of America&#x2019;s most gruesome deaths. Filled with details as fascinating as they are gory, <i>Mop Men </i>examines not just the public fascination with murder but also how a self-made success like Smither can make a fortune just by praying for death. <p></p><br><br></p><p><br><br>ALAN EMMINS has written for <i>GQ</i>, <i>The New York Post</i>, <i>Dazed &amp; Confused</i>, <i>FHM</i>, <i>Playboy</i>, and <i>The New York Daily News</i>. He is also managing editor of the fiction magazine and website Edit Red. Emmins is British, but has worked mainly in New York. He now lives in Denmark.<br><br>Who cleans up when a killer leaves a really big bloody mess? In a chatty, tongue-in-cheek profile of Neal Smither, chief of Crime Scene Cleaners Inc., journalist Emmins lets the Boss Cleaner speak passionately of how he tackles spills and splotches resulting from the San Francisco Bay area's murders, suicides and other deaths. Emmins delves into the zany character of Smither, a loving family man who puts on a coarsely humorous persona as protective armor as he surrounds himself with the dark realm of death, monitoring his multimillion-dollar business in a highly competitive field. Hanging around with Smither means a grisly experience of suicide surrounded by transgender porn, bodies splattered by gunfire or the decayed corpses of those ruined by meth or contagious disease. For a totally gonzo way of looking at the crime scene cleaning business, try this engrossing, wisecracking assessment (of Smither, Emmins writes, [I]f not actually one of Death's litter, he must be at barest minimum a cousin) of a world we know exists but ignore as we go on about our lives. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In spite of MaDear&#39;s failing health. In spite of the breakup of a teenage love. In spite of the curse of HIV. In spite of prison time hanging over the head of a beloved child. In spite of a startling wedding. Out of the ashes, God is doing a new thing. As the prayer group heads into a new year fraught with change, Jodi Baxter and her Yada sisters are realizing it is either hunker down with the safe and stagnant, or get rolling with God -- even if it means letting go of the old and embracing the new.</p><p><b>Neta Jackson's</b> award-winning Yada books have sold more than 800,000 copies and are spawning prayer groups across the country.

Twitter: @ DaveNetaJackson Facebook: DaveNetaJackson<p> Stepping over Willie Wonka's inert body sprawled on the floor, I groped in the shadows behind the Christmas tree for the electric cord, felt for the outlet, and plugged it in. Instantly, a glittering fairyland replaced the early morning gloom. Framed neatly by the bay window in the front room of our first-floor apartment, the six-foot fir tree we'd found at Poor Bob's Tree Lot winked and twinkled its multicolored minilights like little blessings. </p> <p> Shivering, I pulled Denny's robe tighter around me and drank in the sight. If I had to choose between Christmas presents or a Christmas tree, I'd take the tree any day. Memories hung from every branch. Orange-juice-lid ornaments the kids made when they were in kindergarten bobbed nobly on the front branches. The ornaments we'd given both kids each year had multiplied until they actually filled up the tree. I smiled. That was a tradition I'd brought to our marriage from my family, who had carefully packed up <em>my</em> ornaments as a wedding present when I got married. As we would do when Josh and Amanda-- </p> <p> My smile faded. <em>Ack!</em> Didn't want to go <em>there</em>. I dreaded the Christmas our tree would be denuded of our kids' ornaments. </p> <p> I heard the coffee gurgling its last gasps as the pot filled. Scurrying back to the kitchen as fast as the stiffness in my left leg would let me, I poured my first mug of the day and then settled into the recliner facing the glittering tree for a few quiet moments before our Saturday began. It had been a nice Christmas--nothing spectacular, but nice. Leslie Stuart, our upstairs neighbor and one of my Yada Yada sisters, had invited her parents to visit her for a few days--a Christmas miracle big enough to warrant a few angels singing, "Glory! Hallelujah!" if you asked me. We'd met the senior Stuarts briefly when they'd arrived at our shared two-flat on Christmas Eve, but we'd officially invited the three of them for supper tonight. </p> <p> Which meant I had to get everything ready this morning, since Ruth and Ben Garfield had also asked us and the other Yada Yadas to their house for baby Isaac's <em>brit mila</em> this afternoon. </p> <p><em> "Brit mila? What's that?" </em> I'd blurted when Ruth called me the day before Christmas. </p> <p><em> "Brit mila---the ritual circumcision ceremony. A newborn Jewish male is joined to the Jewish people on the eighth day. Read your Bible, Jodi." </em></p> <p> I had ignored the dig.<em> "Don't they do that in the hospital nowadays? With Josh--" </em></p> <p><em> "Is your Josh Jewish? Didn't think so. So, are you coming?" </em></p> <p><em> "Wait a minute. The twins were born almost a month ago. What happened to the eighth day?" </em></p> <p> A long pause. Not like Ruth, who usually filled up gaps in conversation like rainwater flowing into sidewalk cracks. I had immediately regretted my blunt question and started to apologize, but Ruth had just sighed.<em> "Pediatrician said we had to wait. Preemies, you know. But . . ." </em>Her voice had brightened.<em> "All is well. Havah and Isaac came home from the hospital on their due date---last Saturday. So </em>this<em> Saturday is the 'official' eighth day. The eighth day of Hanukkah too. See? God is good." </em></p> <p><em> "All the time," </em> I'd agreed.<em> "Sure, we'll be there."</em></p> <p> Should have checked with my family first. </p> <p><em> "Mo-om," </em> Amanda had wailed.<em> "That's gross! If they gotta do that circumcision thing, at least do it in private. Not with everybody gawking at that poor naked baby. He'll be so embarrassed when he's thirteen and we all say, 'My, how you've grown! I was at your circumcision.'" </em></p> <p> I had ignored her. Sixteen-year-olds are embarrassed by everything. But even Denny had blanched.<em> "Uh, I dunno, Jodi. I'm kinda squeamish. What if I faint?" </em></p> <p> Josh, however, was the only one with a real excuse.<em> "Sorry, Mom. We're doing a Christmas party at Manna House for the kids."</em></p> <p> Now it was Saturday. The Big Day for Ben and Ruth. I sipped the hot coffee, feeling its lingering warmth. The sky beyond the bay windows--more visible in winter through the bare tree branches lining our narrow street on Chicago's north side--had begun to lighten. <em>Well, God,</em> I thought, <em>this year is almost over, a new one about to begin. Didn't I tell You I could use some "dull and boring" last year about this time? What happened, huh?</em></p> <p> Huh. Fact was, it had been a tough year for the Yada Yada Prayer Group all the way around. Nonyameko's husband, Mark, beaten up after that racist rally . . . Chanda finding out she had breast cancer . . . Florida's boy arrested and locked up in the juvenile detention center . . . Avis's daughter ending up at the Manna House shelter for abused and homeless women . . . Ruth--childless, on her third husband, and pushing fifty--discovering she was pregnant with <em>twins</em> . . . Josh, our firstborn, refusing to go to college and falling in love with an "older woman" . . . </p> <p><em> Didn't I walk with you every step of the way?</em> The Voice in my spirit spoke gently but firmly. <em>Have I brought you this far to leave you now? </em></p> <p> "Yes, Lord, thank You," I whispered. "And . . . I guess it's a good thing You don't show us everything that's going to happen ahead of time." Because if this coming year was anything like the last year and a half since I'd met the rest of the Yada Yadas at that Chicago Women's Conference, change was in the wind. </p> <p> Just then, Willie Wonka wheezed noisily to his feet and pushed his wet nose into my lap, rear end wiggling impatiently. Translated: <em>I gotta go out--now.</em></p> <p> Yeah, well. Some things <em>never</em> change. </p> <p>----------------------------- </p> <p> By the time the three of us Baxters squeezed into the Garfields' compact living room that afternoon, there wasn't much room to sit. Amanda--as I'd suspected--wouldn't dream of being left behind, though her face fell when she realized Delores and Ricardo Enriques had left all the kids at home. Amanda never missed an opportunity to show up when Delores's sixteen-year-old son Jos� might be there. </p> <p> I spied Ruth standing by the front window holding one of the twins; Delores, standing beside her, was patting the other twin over her shoulder. Had to be the boy. Even from across the room I could see the large red birthmark covering a third of the baby's face. I winced, not yet used to such a conspicuous raspberry. </p> <p> I quickly counted Yada Yada noses. Besides Ruth and Delores, I spied Hoshi Takahashi and Nonyameko Sisulu-Smith sitting on the couch--but not Nony's husband, Mark, who was still recovering from his head injury. Yo-Yo Spencer, who'd been taken under the Garfields' wing when she got out of prison after doing time for forgery, perched on the arm of the couch . . . was that <em>it</em>? Only five of us? Well, six, counting myself. Where was everybody? </p> <p> But I only had time to give the couch sitters a quick wave before a bearded man wearing a prayer shawl began to chant a prayer. Voices immediately hushed all around the cramped living room. This must be the <em>mohel, </em>who, according to Ruth, would perform the ceremony. <em>"An expert he is, trained to do the circumcision with minimal discomfort," </em>she'd told us on the phone. Then she'd muttered,<em> "He'd better be."</em></p> <p> After the prayer, the <em>mohel </em>called out, "Kvatter!" </p> <p> Heads turned as Ruth nodded to Delores. "Delores Enriques is <em>kvatterin,</em> the child's godmother," she announced with that stubborn tilt of her chin, daring anyone to disagree. My mouth dropped in delight, and I saw our Yada Yada sisters exchange astonished smiles as Delores, blushing up to her hair roots, tenderly cradled the little boy and made her way toward the other end of the room where she handed the baby to her husband, Ricardo. </p> <p> "And Ricardo Enriques is <em>kvatter</em>, the child's godfather," Ruth announced. </p> <p> Again, little gasps of surprise and pleasure circled the room. <em>Well, well,</em> I thought. <em>No one deserves it more than Delores; she stuck with Ruth through this pregnancy like white on rice.</em> But Ricardo. <em>That</em> was a surprise--though, sure, it made sense to have husband and wife be the godparents. They were hardly Jewish, though. </p> <p> As Ricardo took the baby, the <em>mohel</em> with the prayer shawl said, "<em>Baruch haba</em>," while Ruth and several others responded, "May he who cometh be blessed." And then the <em>mohel </em>offered another prayer, mentioning God's covenant with Abraham, the sign of which was circumcision. ". . . and through Abraham's seed, all nations will be blessed." And we all said, "Amen." </p> <p> The <em>mohel</em> took the baby from Ricardo Enriques and handed him to someone sitting in a straight-back chair. Craning my neck, I saw Ruth's husband, Ben--a brand-new daddy at sixty-something--take his tiny son and place him on a large pillow on his lap. Ruth, coming up behind me, muttered in my ear, "Huh. Would Ben let anyone else hold his only son for his <em>brit mila</em>? Lucy would let Charlie Brown kick the football first." </p> <p> I had to stuff my fist against my mouth to keep from laughing. </p> <p> "--Oh Lord, King of the universe," the <em>mohel</em> was praying once again, "who has sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us concerning the rite of circumcision." And then there was murmuring and rustling. Backs closed in around Ben and the baby. </p> <p><em> This is it!</em> I thought, looking away. I steeled myself for-- </p> <p> A wail broke the hush in the room. Ruth was fanning herself big-time. I could hear Ben's growly voice soothing and shushing his child as the <em>mohel</em> finished his administrations. As Isaac's wail subsided, sighs of relief and whispers filled the room. </p> <p> Then the <em>mohel</em> lifted his voice once more. "Creator of the universe, may it be Thy gracious will"--I leaned forward, trying to hear--"and give a pure and holy heart to <em>Yitzak,</em> to be called Isaac, the son of Ben and Ruth Garfield, who ha...</p></p><h2>Money (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Porn freak and jetsetter, John Self, is the shameless heir to a fast-food culture where money beats out an invitation to futile self-gratification.

In 1325, she was sent to her homeland to negotiate a peace settlement between her husband and her brother Charles IV, king of France. She refused to return. Instead, she began a relationship with her husband&#x2019;s deadliest enemy, the English baron Roger Mortimer. With the king&#x2019;s son and heir, the future Edward III, under their control, the pair led an invasion of England which ultimately resulted in Edward II&#x2019;s forced abdication in January 1327. Isabella and Mortimer ruled England during Edward III&#x2019;s minority until he overthrew them in October 1330.A rebel against her own husband and king, and regent for her son, Isabella was a powerful, capable and intelligent woman. She forced the first ever abdication of a king in England, and thus changed the course of English history. Examining Isabella&#x2019;s life with particular focus on her revolutionary actions in the 1320s, this book corrects the many myths surrounding her and provides a vivid account of this most fascinating and influential of women.</p><p>Kathryn Warner holds two degrees in medieval history from the University of Manchester.

But not everyone interprets it the same way. A major faultline runs through Tibetan Buddhism around the interpretation of what are called the two truths--the deceptive truth of conventional appearances and the ultimate truth of emptiness. An understanding of this faultline illuminates the beliefs that separate the Gelug descendents of Tsongkhapa from contemporary Dzogchen and Mahamudra adherents. <i>The Two Truths Debate</i> digs into the debate of how the two truths are defined and how they are related by looking at two figures, one on either side of the faultline, and shows how their philosophical positions have dramatic implications for how one approaches Buddhist practice and how one understands enlightenment itself.</p><p>Jay Garfield is Doris Silbert Professor in the Humanities, Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Logic Program and of the Five College Tibetan Studies in India Program at Smith College, Professor in the graduate faculty of Philosophy at the University of Massachusetts, Professor of Philosophy at Melbourne University and Adjunct Professor of Philosophy at the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies.&nbsp; He teaches and pursues research in the philosophy of mind, foundations of cognitive science, logic, philosophy of language, Buddhist philosophy, cross-cultural hermeneutics, theoretical and applied ethics and epistemology.

OUR NEW INCARNATION OF THE BOOK IS A TITLE AND COVER CHANGE ONLY. CONTENT INSIDE THE BOOK IS THE SAME. The social mind... It&#39;s always on the job, even when you&#39;re off the job! Most people are born with an intuitive sense of the social world that allows them to naturally be aware of social expectations and feeds them the information they need to follow the social code. But not everyone is born with intuitive social understanding. Social learning challenges can be especially noticeable in the workplace, where it&#39;s assumed employees understand not only how to do their job but how to effectively work in a group, understand the hidden rules of office etiquette and office politics, and build and maintain solid professional relationships with others. This 200+ page book is a primer about the social mind in the workplace, but the concepts and strategies are equally applicable in all areas of life. It&#39;s largely based on the authors&#39; years of clinical experience working with adults who struggle socially, but may or may not identify their problems with a specific diagnosis. Many are highly intelligent and skilled employees who find it difficult to decipher the often nuanced social underpinnings that are part of daily life, on or off the job. Individuals with social challenges want to be appreciated for who they are and how they contribute (just like all of us do!), but often their good intentions aren&#39;t communicated in a way that others easily understand. As a result, it&#39;s often tough for these individuals to build the relationships and reputation necessary to excel in the workplace, regardless of their expertise or how hard they work.</p><p></p><h2>Goodbye to Poplarhaven: Recollections of a Utah Boyhood</h2><p>Edward A.

An editor at the Chicago Tribune , O'Shea here offers an astute appraisal of the political, economic and social climate which fostered the thrifts crisis. The author focuses on entrepreneur Donald Dixon's purchase of a seemingly sound, federally insured Vernon, Tex., S &amp; L which--thanks in part to Reagan-era deregulations--allowed Dixon to fund reckless ventures and a lavish lifestyle, despite $3 billion invested in delinquent loans. So huge was the thrift's disarray and fraud by 1986, when federal officials seized it, that O'Shea contends the bank should have been closed, not salvaged.

She follows the moon into the woods, leading her loved ones away from their master. There's only one place where he might not find them, and it's under the quilt of night. <br> Guided by the stars, they head north in the direction of freedom. At last, the girl sees a quilt -- the quilt with a center square made from deep blue fabric -- and knows it's a signal from friends on the Underground Railroad, welcoming her into their home. And so she steps forward... <br> Deborah Hopkinson and James E. Ransome team up again, in this stunning companion to <i>Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt.</i> Ransome's rich, powerful illustrations elicit all the emotion and suspense of Hopkinson's words, in a story that's sure to make your heart race and leave you breathless.</p><p>Under the quilt of night a young slave girl leads her loved ones away from the slave master who worked them: "hoeing and picking, / mending and sewing, / till my hands got raw." In this striking companion to Deborah Hopkinson and James Ransome's <i>Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt</i>, Hopkinson uses the rhythm of verse to echo the drumming of the slaves' feet as they travel along the Underground Railroad in pre-Civil War times. Ransome's oil painting illustrations are rich with the purple hues of night, and fraught with the tense emotions of the men, women, and children trying to escape--and those helping them. Over the course of the story, the deep purple gradually lightens, as the sun begins to rise and the slaves approach freedom. The final illustration is a veritable sunburst of brilliant orange and yellow. Our heroine's voice "flies up in song. / My own song / of running in sunshine / and dancing through fields. / I'll jump every fence in my way." A truly glorious celebration of the brave souls who kept alive the secret network of people helping others escape slavery.

This wonderful collection of more than 100 recipes takes kids around the world without ever leaving the kitchen, and results in great food they're more likely to eat because they've made it themselves. Start in Africa with African Fruit Salad, Black-eyed Pea Balls, or Kenyan Crunchy Bananas. Move on to the Caribbean with Callaloo Soup, Curried Coconut Vegetable, and Island Fruit Smoothies, or venture all the way to Russia for Chicken Kiev, Apple-Cinnamon Baba, and Strawberries Romanoff. Each recipe is carefully rated from one to four "utensils" for level of difficulty and the amount of adult supervision required. In addition to the recipes, each section begins with a short cultural lesson about the highlighted country or region and the kinds of food found there. <i>Passport on a Plate</i> is an ideal cookbook for children and parents to learn from together.Grade 4-8. This international cookbook contains 100 recipes from Africa, the Caribbean, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, and Vietnam. Each place is introduced in a one-and-a-half-page explanation of the area's foods and eating habits. The recipes are rated at four levels of difficulty, and each one is put into context with an introductory sentence or two. They are clearly written and carefully chosen to represent the locale and the foods that are grown there; however, it is sometimes necessary to vary ingredients for American cooks, and sometimes prepared foods are used to simplify the recipe. Some of the "four utensils" directions are difficult indeed, involving frying in deep fat, whipping cream, dealing with fillo dough, filling seaweed for sushi, etc. Nevertheless, the dishes are good and are more or less authentic. For more thorough information about the food and cooking of individual countries, see the "Easy Menu" series (Lerner). The Kids' Around the World Cookbook (Kingfisher, 1994) by Deri Robins is easier.

By the author of Araminta Station.</p><p>Continuing his tales of Cadwal, governed for generations by the Conservancy, which is dedicated to preserving the planet's natural beauty, Vance posits a scenario in which the Conservancy is now rent by factional conflict between the radical Life, Peace and Freedom Party and the conservative Chartists. LPFers ostensibly champion the cause of the Yips, happy-go-lucky descendants of runaway servants, illegal immigrants and petty criminals who are restricted to a region called Lutwen Atoll except when serving as cheap labor at Araminta Station, which is the administrative center and home to the Chartists, who uphold the original plan to restrict the spread of humanity across Cadwal. When a new, stricter Charter arrives, the inhabitants of Stroma, the only other settlement on the planet and the LPF center, are ordered to move to Araminta Station. Sinister undercurrents presage a full-scale conspiracy involving the Yips and longtime enemies of Cadwal. The popular Vance ( Ecce and Old Earth ) pens an often lively tale with some colorful moments and acerbic observations on politics and mores, although his mannered language and strained descriptions may put off the discriminating reader. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.Vengeance and unrequited love are the motivating factors behind an insidious plot to destroy the Cadwal Conservancy as agents Glawen Clattuc and Eustace Chilke track an elusive enemy across several worlds only to return home at last to find a revolution in the making. Vance's polished and formal style creates an emotional gap that is difficult to bridge; consequently, his characters lack real depth. Still, this follow-up to Araminta Station (Tor, 1989) and Ecce and Old Earth (Underwood/Miller, 1991) demonstrates the author's talent for imagining worlds and environments.

When Colonel Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders invaded Cuba in 1898, it marked "the beginning of imperial America. . . . Now, by God, the sun would never set on Old Glory." Eben Pay, openminded U.S. attorney from Arkansas, and his bighearted Osage Indian sidekick Joe Mountain are both drawn into the war against Spain. Though the unlikely friendship between the protagonists seems somewhat forced, Jones's inspired rendering of the other characters more than compensates. Among them are Dylan Price, cracker-barrel philosopher of soldiering; prim Carlina Newton, who awakens to the blood-red horrors of war; her mentor, Red Cross nurse Clara Barton; and profane-mouthed Major General William Shafter, "that great, sweating, inefficient man." Jones captures the cowardice, heroism and confusion, the jingoism whipped up by the press, troops dying of bullet wounds and typhoid in mosquito-infested jungles. Employing his assiduous research with panache, he spins a narrative crackling with authentic, gritty detail. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mosaic Workshop: A Guide to Designing and Creating Mosaics</h2><p>A guide to the decorative art demonstrates design techniques using color, contrast, texture, pattern, and movement to guide beginners through twenty-four original projects</p><p>The ancient decorative art of mosaic is, today, increasingly appreciated for the beauty it can bring to the home, both inside and out.

Instead, his drawing style is more a blend of modern Disney (<i>Hercules</i>, <i>Mulan</i>), Don Bluth (<i>Dragon's Lair</i>), and the Cartoon Network (<i>Powderpuff Girls</i>, <i>Samurai Jack</i>, <i>Star Wars: Clone Wars</i>). Unfortunately, only Caldwell's sketches are included, and not his colored and finished drawings. Although the rough lines are dynamic and eye-catching, a whole book of unfinished art is enough to try the most generous reader's patience.

Foremost among them was the Bush Administration&#39;s and the Republican leadership&#39;s failure to recognize the need to invest in education, now and in the future. Tracing the genesis of his decision, Jeffords describes his attempts to effect change within his party, and the pain of hurting Republican colleagues and friends. His decision came just at the moment when his defection would deprive them of the Washington trifecta they had recently achieved -- Republican control of the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. It was also going to cost many of his friends committee chairmanships they had acquired only a few months before. &#34;But in the end,&#34; he writes, &#34;I had to be true to what I thought was right, and leave the consequences to sort themselves out in the days ahead.&#34; In a contemporary Profiles in Courage, Senator Jeffords provides a moving, witty, and instructive example of what can happen in public life. Whether you agree with his views or not, his account of his tough decisions, and of his anguish at rejecting the last-minute appeals of the leadership of his party, the President, and his wife, is a riveting story that has wide implications for the whole country.</p><p>Born in Rutland, Vermont, on May 11, 1934, <b>James Merrill Jeffords</b> is the son of the late Marion H. Jeffords and the late Olin M. Jeffords, former Chief Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court. His father's family settled in northwestern Vermont in 1794. After attending public schools in Rutland, Jeffords received his undergraduate degree from Yale University in 1956 and his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1962. Jeffords served active duty with the U.S. Navy from 1956 to 1959, and retired from the U.S. Naval Reserve as a captain in 1990. He is married to Elizabeth Daley, and they have a daughter, Laura, a son, Leonard, and a daughter-in-law, Maura. The Jeffords live in Shrewsbury, Vermont.<p><b>Chapter One: Obscure Senator, Small State</b> </p><p> I must have walked the corridors of National Airport, now named Reagan National, seven or eight hundred times heading home to Vermont. Though people may imagine the life of a Senator as somewhat distant and glorious, for much of our lives we are first cousins of the traveling salesman. Marriages fail, children suffer, and friends are lost. If this time my mood was on the gloomy side, it was because I had just left a meeting where I had very likely lost a few more friends. It was easily the toughest meeting of the thousands I have had during my three decades in politics. </p><p> I was heading for Burlington, Vermont, the trip I had made so many times before, but tonight's eight o'clock flight was anything but routine. Although I had yet to fully appreciate this fact, the people at the airline had, and I had been steered by the airline's personnel to a VIP lounge just beyond the security checkpoint. </p><p> It seemed like the first half hour in days that I had a chance to catch my breath. The morning papers scattered about the room had given the story of my considering leaving front-page coverage with photos. The television was running the story almost constantly. Even the business news gave it play, attributing some of the movement in the stock market to speculation about my pending announcement. </p><p> My press secretary, Erik Smulson, had been so deluged by phone calls from reporters and producers that this was his first chance to see what was going on around us. Like me, he was amazed by the wall-to-wall coverage. Erik's job had been transformed over the past few days from trying to generate news to trying to contain it at some manageable level. </p><p> As the flight's departure time neared, we left the lounge and headed down the corridor to Gate 35A, the low-tech launching pad for the jets and prop planes headed for the small cities of the East Coast. I soon realized why the airline staff had intervened. A hundred yards away, dozens of reporters had staked out the little gate, with TV cameras and microphones pointed my way. This was not going to be another milk run to Burlington. </p><p> Before I reached the press, I got my first taste that my deliberations had pierced the veil of public indifference that often attends what Congress does or does not do. On both sides of the broad aisle, passengers awaiting their flight stood on their chairs and started cheering and applauding, while others pushed forward to shake my hand. This for someone who a few days before may have ranked about 99th on the U.S. Senate celebrity scale. </p><p> People don't much care what Congress does, and in a democracy, that can be a very good thing. There are, and should be, more important things in people's lives than who a Senator from a small state might be, or what he might do. But here were scores of people who not only recognized me but also approved of what they thought I would be doing the next day in Vermont, who literally wanted to reach out and touch me. It was extraordinary that the glare of media attention in just a few days had thrust me before people's eyes in a way that was flattering but not entirely comfortable. How had what I thought or done to that point so touched these people? </p><p> After running the press gauntlet, something I had some practice in after the past few days, my wife Liz, Erik, my chief of staff, Susan Russ, and I rode a shuttle bus out across the tarmac to the plane. </p><p> I had tried throughout the past few days to keep a level head about me, but my family and staff took no chances. Lest I had invested too much meaning into the reception I had just received, Susan pointed out that the people cheering me were waiting for a plane to Boston, hardly a political cross section of the country. </p><p> Our plane was a small jet, three seats across, which was a blessing for the Vermont delegation in Congress compared to the small props connecting through Pittsburgh or LaGuardia that used to be our only alternative. The flight usually had a Vermont flavor -- a few students from the University, an engineer from IBM, a state employee or two heading home from a conference in Washington, sometimes even Ben or Jerry. It is pretty common to know a few people on the trip; such is the size of my state. </p><p> But tonight the press had commandeered it. Within a few minutes of announcing at midday that I would travel to Vermont to make a statement the next day, the seats were sold out (which is not saying all that much, I suppose). UVM may have been represented on the flight, but so were the network news shows, newspapers from London, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Tokyo, and camera crews from who knows where. </p><p> But it was not all strangers. The father of my former state director was on the flight, though I have to admit it was awkward seeing him. His daughter had left my office and with my support had won a job in the new Bush Administration, as head of the Vermont-New Hampshire USDA Rural Development office. Hers is one of a handful of jobs in a state that a Senator can have a role in filling when the President is from the same party. She is immensely qualified and a good Republican, but who could know her fate at that point? Would my candidates for the Vermont U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal, and Farm Service Agency Director jobs be at risk as well? Yet more people whose lives my decision would touch. </p><p> My wife Liz, one of the people most affected, was seated next to me on the plane. While normally as voluble as I am quiet, she had little to say as we settled in for the flight. Over the past week, we had said about all there was to say on the topic of my party affiliation. </p><p> Liz is an independent soul, but she has to be labeled a liberal. How else do you describe someone who was an early supporter of Reverend Jesse Jackson's bid for the presidency, and who put up a yard sign for the Democrat running for Governor the same year I was running as a Republican for the U.S. Senate? </p><p> In the instant and sometimes inaccurate analysis that characterized much of the coverage of my decision, Liz was rumored by some to have been the catalyst for my switch, when in fact the opposite was true. She thought it was a bad idea, said so repeatedly and in very unvarnished terms, but gave me tremendous support once she realized my decision was close to being made. She is not one to stand meekly by her man. But I think she realized the anguish I was enduring and wanted me to do what I thought was right. </p><p> It may be hard to understand if you are fed a steady diet of caricatures, but the Senate consists of real people, many of whom have personalities as magnetic as their political views can be repellent. I thought Liz would be the last to place much stock in the relationships you can develop in Washington. I traveled home to Vermont almost every weekend. She chose to spend most of her time there, leaving our home on the back side of Killington Mountain only once or twice a year to visit Washington, D.C. But she found, as I did, that political views do not always provide a window on someone's personality. Senator Jesse Helms and his wife, Dorothy, would not agree with Liz on many issues, but they are two of the nicest people you could ever meet. </p><p> Is it possible to divorce political views from your opinion of a person?

These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten.

For Sale--American Paradise hones in on the experiences of American icon William Jennings Bryan, journalist Edwin Menninger, and others who shaped the image of Florida that we know today and who sold that image as America's paradise. The cast also includes the Marx Brothers, Thomas Edison, Al Capone, a pack of backwoods bandits known as the Ashley Gang, and the visionaries and businessmen who poured their dreams and their cash into Florida in the roaring, raucous 1920s. <br><br>A tale of a colorful and tragicomic era during which the allure and illusion of the American Dream was on full display--a Jazz Age period when Americans started chasing what F. Scott Fitzgerald called "the orgiastic future"--the book reveals how the 2008 collapse of Florida real estate was eerily similar to events that happened there in the 1920s What sets the mid-1920s' Florida land boom apart from more recent booms-and-busts, however, is that this was the first time that emerging new technologies, mass communications, and modern advertising techniques were used to sell the nation on the notion that prosperity and happiness are entitlements that are simply there for the taking. <br><br>Florida's image as a place where the rules of everyday life don't apply and winners go to play was formed during this dawn of the age of consumerism when Americans wanted to have fun and make lots of money, and millions of them thought Florida was the perfect place to do that.</p><p>Willie Drye has been a journalist for thrity-three years and is a contributing editor for National Geographic News. His first book Storm of the Century: The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, was made into a documentary for the History Channel. He lives in North Carolina, dividing his time between Plymouth and Wilmington.In the early years of the twentieth century, it took the efforts of some very determined people &#x2013; including William Jennings Bryan and Henry Flagler, cofounder of Standard Oil &#x2013; to draw the country&#x2019;s attention to the state of Florida, which so the claims went, represented a huge opportunity for real-estate investors. In addition to developers, the relatively untamed state also attracted the attention of the criminal element: religious leader and Hollow Earth proponent Cyrus Teed; outlaw bank robber, murderer, and pop-culture hero John Ashley; and of course, furniture salesman Al Brown, who&#x2019;s probably better known by his real surname, Capone. This lively, fascinating look at Florida&#x2019;s early years profiles all these figures and describes not only the early growth but also the bursting of the bubble in the late 1920s, the result of a declining economy, the increasing profile of the crooks, and a hurricane that destroyed entire cities. Revealing reading for anyone interested in early-twentieth-century American history, boom-and-bust stories, and tales of outlaws. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Drye (Storm of the Century) weaves stories of economic development, railroad construction, and outlaw behavior in this tale of Florida&#x2019;s early boom years and the ensuing hurricane-triggered bust. On paper, Florida didn&#x2019;t look like the most inviting of locales when it became a state in 1845. Hurricanes, roaring heat, alligators, and the impenetrable Everglades were enough to keep most folks away. In 1867, Harriet Beecher Stowe built a winter home near Jacksonville and began to sing Florida&#x2019;s praises with rhapsodic descriptions of the state&#x2019;s natural beauty, setting in motion a series of dispatches by Ulysses S. Grant, William Jennings Bryan, Warren G. Harding, and others encouraging northerners to consider the state as a vacation or respite destination&#x2014;Miami in particular. A period of rapid growth followed, with roads and railroads connecting Miami to the Florida Keys as well as one carved through the formidable Everglades connecting Fort Myers to Miami, further enabling economic development. A lax attitude toward Prohibition didn&#x2019;t hurt either. Drye has clearly done his research, but his narrative can be jarring with few segues between narrative threads. Still, Floridians, snowbirds and historians are sure to appreciate the story behind one of America&#x2019;s most famous vacation spots. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Check out <i>For Sale: American Paradise</i>. Drye tells history the way it should be told." (<i>Florida Times-Union</i>)<br><br>National Geographic News contributing editor Drye (Storm of the Century) paints 1920s South Florida as a phantasmagoria--a commodified fantasy peddled by an elite so as to exploit the masses. As William Jennings Bryan and other public figures boosted Florida for its warm climate and leisurely lifestyle, real estate speculators sold off undeveloped swampland to gullible northerners for wildly inflated prices. In time the market crashed because, in the words of one speculator, "we just ran out of suckers." Hurricanes also disrupted this metanarrative of paradise, devastating Miami in 1926 and inundating the Lake Okeechobee region in 1928. But state and business leaders downplayed the impact as "negligible," lest reports of thousands of corpses floating in the sugarcane fields scare off tourists. Meanwhile, Florida crime shifted from charismatic bootleggers and bandits such as John Ashley, who robbed banks and then fled to hideouts deep in the Everglades, to organized crime--Chicago mobster Al Capone wintered in Miami. Drye expertly weaves entertaining anecdotes and local color into his narrative, which often reads like a Carl Hiaasen novel.

Angry glances struck upon their backs.</p><p>The Modern Library is proud to include Virginia Woolf's first novel, The Voyage Out--together with a new Introduction by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Cunningham. Published to acclaim in England in 1915 and in America five years later, The Voyage Out marks Woolf's beginning as one of the twentieth century's most brilliant and prolific writers. <br>Less formally experimental than her later novels, The Voyage Out none-theless clearly lays bare the poetic style and innovative technique--with its multiple figures of consciousness, its detailed portraits of characters' inner lives, and its constant shifting between the quotidian and the profound--that are the signature of Woolf's fiction. <br>Rachel Vinrace, Woolf's first heroine, is a motherless young woman who, at twenty-four, embarks on a sea voyage with a party of other English folk to South America. Guileless, and with only a smattering of education, Rachel is taken under the wing of her aunt Helen, who desires to teach Rachel "how to live."Arriving in Santa Marina, a village on the South American coast, Rachel and Helen are introduced to a group of English expatriates. Among them is the young, sensitive Terence Hewet, an aspiring writer, with whom Rachel falls in love. But theirs is ultimately a tale of doomed love, set against a chorus of other stories and other points of view, as the narrative shifts focus between its central and peripheral characters. E. M. Forster praised The Voyage Out as "a book which attains unity as surely as "Wuthering Heights, though by a different path." <br>This edition includes a new Introduction by Michael Cunningham, bestselling author of "The Hours. Cunningham at once unfolds an engaging shortessay of Woolf's early life and career, an insightful exploration of the themes to which Woolf returns again and again in her fiction, and a spirited defense of the relevance and lasting importance of her art. Katherine Anne Porter wrote of Woolf: "The world of arts was her native territory; she ranged freely under her own sky, speaking her mother tongue fearlessly."The Voyage Out (1915) is the story of a rite of passage. When Rachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father&#39;s ship she is launched on a course of self-discovery in a modern version of the mythic voyage. Virginia Woolf knew all too well the forms that she was supposed to follow when writing of a young lady&#39;s entrance into the world, and she struggled to subvert the conventions, wittily and assiduously, rewriting and revising the novel many times. The finished work is not, on the face of it, a &#39;portrait of the artist&#39;. However, through The Voyage Out readers discover Woolf as an emerging and original artist: not identified with the heroine, but present everywhere in the social satire, the lyricism, and the patterning of consciousness.</p><h2>The Shortest History of Germany</h2><p>Shortest History of Germany</p><p></p><h2>By the Numbers: Book #1 - The Road to Cao Bang</h2><p>By The Numbers: Bokk #! - The Road To Cao Bang</p><p>Born in 1959, Laurent Rullier is a French comics writer.

Before the Second World War began, approximately thirty thousand Americans lived in Paris, and when war broke out in 1939 almost five thousand remained. As citizens of a neutral nation, the Americans in Paris believed they had little to fear. They were wrong. Glass's discovery of letters, diaries, war documents, and police files reveals as never before how Americans were trapped in a web of intrigue, collaboration, and courage.<br><br> Artists, writers, scientists, playboys, musicians, cultural mandarins, and ordinary businessmen-all were swept up in extraordinary circumstances and tested as few Americans before or since. Charles Bedaux, a French-born, naturalized American millionaire, determined his alliances as a businessman first, a decision that would ultimately make him an enemy to all. Countess Clara Longworth de Chambrun was torn by family ties to President Roosevelt and the Vichy government, but her fiercest loyalty was to her beloved American Library of Paris. Sylvia Beach attempted to run her famous English-language bookshop, Shakespeare &amp; Company, while helping her Jewish friends and her colleagues in the Resistance. Dr. Sumner Jackson, wartime chief surgeon of the American Hospital in Paris, risked his life aiding Allied soldiers to escape to Britain and resisting the occupier from the first day. These stories and others come together to create a unique portrait of an eccentric, original, diverse American community.<br><br> Charles Glass has written an exciting, fast-paced, and elegant account of the moral contradictions faced by Americans in Paris during France's dangerous occupation years. For four hard years, from the summer of 1940 until U.S. troops liberated Paris in August 1944, Americans were intimately caught up in the city's fate. <i>Americans in Paris</i> is an unforgettable tale of treachery by some, cowardice by others, and unparalleled bravery by a few.<br></p><p><strong>Charles Glass</strong> is the author of <em>Americans in Paris</em>, <em>Tribes with Flags, </em>and<em> The Northern Front: An Iraq War Diary, </em>among other books.

Drawing heavily on primary source material, Glass narrates the Nazi Occupation year by year, unfolding stories of resilience and despair. . . By focussing with exhaustive thoroughness on a relatively small group, Glass is able to capture the complex stories of 'as diverse a collection of opposed beliefs and backgrounds as in any American metropolis.' '' --<i>New Yorker</i><br><br>''Once upon a time, historians told stories about the brave and the cowardly, about heroes, villains, and the many whose lives lay somewhere in between.

It's difficult to conceive of anyone who wouldn't enjoy this exceptional book. --<i>Library Journal</i><br><br>''A fascinating treat.'' --<i>Telegraph</i> (London)<br><br> ''Charles Glass handles this rich and complex material well. . .

The mice have names--Frisky, Graysey, and Longtail. And they are "very dutiful and loving little mice who seldom did anything very naughty to make their mother scold them." But Mrs. Grumpy will leave out mince pies and slabs of cheese, and that's too tempting for even the best of little mice. Their exploits become bolder and bolder, yet they escape cat and kittens with ease. They'd probably still be at it but for a large basin of vinegar and the terrible carving knife of Mrs. Grumpy.<br> This version of the familiar story is happily graced with illustrations by Winslow Homer, one of the greatest 19th century painters. These little treasures, originally published with the text as part of the Good Child's Library in 1858, have been lost to the world for many years.

While innumerable writers have dealt at length with the besieged city itself, David Glantz provides for the first time the definitive military history of the conflict waged beyond the city's borders. <br><br>One of the first major Soviet cities threatened by the German blitzkrieg, Leningrad was as much a symbolic target as it was a strategic one for Adolf Hitler, who fully expected the birthplace of the Russian Revolution to be reduced to rubble quickly and with ease. The Red Army's ferocious defense of the city, however, made that impossible.<br><br>Glantz digs deep to recount the full story of how these two military giants bludgeoned each other for nearly three years with a relentless barrage of offensives and counter-offensives designed to crush one another, in horrendous weather and a harsh terrain and with staggering loss of life on both sides. His richly detailed history shows how battles and campaigns were conceived, engaged, and resolved&#x2014;including a half dozen or more "forgotten battles" that took place during the blockade.<br><br>From a crazy quilt of military operations, Glantz reconstructs the border battles of June and July 1941; the little-known battles to liberate southern Leningrad oblast, including the battles for Luga, Narva, Pskov, and Ostrov; and the liberation of northern Leningrad oblast, comprising the Vyborg operation and failed attempts to invade Finland. He explains how these battles shaped the struggle for Leningrad and how they impacted other theaters of operation along the Eastern Front, eventually forcing the Germans into their long and costly retreat back toward Berlin.<br><br>Glantz also provides insights into conditions within the city, adding new details to the horrors of the siege; sheds new light on partisan warfare in the countryside surrounding Leningrad; and corrects errors found in earlier works, revealing among other things the fate of those Soviet commanders who were purged or repressed because of their poor performance in battle.<br><br>Based on an unparalleled access to Russian archival sources and going far beyond the military aspects of such renowned works as Harrison Salisbury's 900 Days, Glantz's book is a testament to the nearly two million Russians who lost their lives during the Leningrad conflict and confirms his status as the preeminent authority on the Russian military experience in World War II.</p><p>"An original and important contribution not only to the battle for Leningrad but also to a wider understanding of the Great Patriotic War.

Father Dowling, a parish priest in Fox River, Indiana, as usual, serves as part counselor, part sounding board, and part moral compass for priests and parishioners alike---not to mention cops and lawyers---and offers help to both Barrett and his accuser.<br>&nbsp;Before Barrett can decide what to do, and before the now-adult woman has made her demands known to the archdiocese, a body washes up on the shore of Lake Michigan, and Barrett becomes the primary suspect in the murder. <br>&nbsp;Also in the mix in this astutely drawn mystery are a failed writer, a parish busybody, an inept lawyer, and an embittered young man, each with his or her own agenda, and it is up to Father Dowling to unravel the links between these people whose lives were separated long ago, only to reconnect in tragedy.Praise for Ralph McInerny&#x2019;s Father Dowling Mysteries&nbsp;&#x201c;Father Dowling is not the average priest, one who dispenses homilies and easy nostrums.

His mother died when he and his older brother were quite young, and his father traveled widely for <i>Collier's Magazine</i>, which was founded and published by his uncle, Peter F. Collier. Bob was expected to become a priest, but before taking his vows he decided against the life of a clergyman and headed off to seek his fortune.<br><br><p>Because of an earlier, seemingly undiagnosable illness which he finally cured through Christian Science, he started investigating how the Mind could so quickly and surely cure an illness which doctors had been working on for months. Clearly there must be powers in the Mind he'd never suspected -- and if it had dominion over his physical self, why could it not cure any financial lack? Why could it not bring him anything of good he might wish?<br><br></p><p>For long months, Bob studied hundreds of books and courses on everything relating to metaphysics and success in life. Whole religions seemed to be built on it. It was a long time before he began to find parts that were really workable in everyday life; a long time before he realized tangible results from his efforts -- but when results began, they came quickly.<br><br></p><p>For some time Robert Collier had had the idea for a set of books on practical psychology. He put this idea into action, working night and day writing the books. Within six months of publication of these books he received more than one million dollars-worth of orders for them. The books were later combined into a single volume entitled <b>The Secret of the Ages</b>. He sold over 300,000 sets of them -- and received thousands of letters telling of wonderful results obtained from the books. He wrote four more courses, and this excellent material was later combined into one book: <b>Riches Within Your Reach</b>. It has been translated into German, Italian, French, and Spanish, and sold all over the world.<br><br></p><p>Robert Collier was a devoted husband and the father of six children. He died of cancer in 1950, but his books endure. <b>Robert Collier Publications, Inc.</b> still exists through the efforts of his widow, and now his children and grandchildren.

He lives on Fripp Island, South Carolina. Read his exclusive Amazon guest review of <i>Ford County</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>In the mail last week, I received a copy of John Grisham&#x2019;s latest fiction. It surprised me that the book was comprised of seven short stories. From the time I first began publishing at Doubleday, they have always made sure that I received a copy of a Grisham book long before it went on sale in the bookstores. He has written 22 books, and I&#x2019;ve read them all as soon as they were available in crisp review copies.</p> <p>I have loved the Grisham books for the same reason that I love the works of John Irving, Richard Russo, or Anne Rivers Siddons: I get hooked by an early page, and pure habit forces me to read until I am issued my walking papers and can return to my normal life. These writers are all wish-bringers who cast spells with the bright enchantment of their stories, and the power of story has retained its glamour and necessity for me. I&#x2019;ve always liked it when Grisham took a sabbatical from his impressive fiction to romp in the field of sports or non-fiction.</p> <p>John surprised me by entering the ring of danger that the short story represents for all writers. In the world of writing, the poets come first as they finger the language like worry beads and wonder where their next meal is coming from. The art of the short story writer is one of economy, concision, and the genius of trying to craft a whole world inside a mason jar. The modern world punishes the short story writer with inattention. The literary reviews keep the short story alive and finger-popping in America today, while the <i>New Yorker</i> tries to strangle the form with its bare hands. But a great short story is a source of joy, and the reading of Chekhov, de Maupassant, Flannery O&#x2019;Connor and others offer pleasures unmatched by any other form. Since I&#x2019;m incapable of writing the short story form, I wanted to see how Grisham fared, knowing the critics would sharpen their swords against him no matter how accomplished his stories might be.</p> <p><i>Ford County</i> is the best writing that John Grisham has ever done. One of the many things I&#x2019;ve admired about his books is his intimate chronicle of Mississippi life in the generations following William Faulkner and Eudora Welty. Grisham writes equally well about the plantation south, the black south, and white-cracker south. Over the years he has used the legal system as an instrument to illuminate the world of mansions and sharecroppers and everything in between as he not only defined Mississippi but also staked it out as his home fictional territory. His short stories were a surprise to me. All of them are very good; three of them, I believe, are great. Grisham has always had a rare gift for breaking hearts when he invokes unforgettable images of the broken, hopeless South. Some of the stories are hilarious, and Grisham&#x2019;s gift of humor has never found a showcase like this. One of these stories should find its way into the anthologies of the best short stories of 2009. It might not happen, but I for one think the stories in <i>Ford County</i> are that damned good.<i>--Pat Conroy</i></p> <p> (Photo � David G.

By 1891 there were twenty-three. Over the same period London&#x2019;s population more than doubled. In this companion volume to Victorian People and Victorian Things, Lord Briggs focuses on the cities of Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, Middlesbrough, Melbourne (an example of a Victorian community overseas) and London, comparing and contrasting their social, political and topographical development. Full of illuminating detail, Victorian Cities presents a unique social, political and economic bird's-eye view of the past.</p><p>The cities of this book are the cities of the railway and tramway age, of the age of steam and of gas, of a society sometimes restless, sometimes complacent, moving, often fumbling and faltering, towards greater democracy. The building of the cities was a characteristic Victorian Achievement, impressive in scale but limited in vision, creating new opportunities but also providing massive new problems.Asa Briggs was born in 1921 at Keighley, Yorkshire, and from 1955 to 1961 he was Professor of Modern History at Leeds University, and in 1961 he was the first academic to be appointed to the then new University of Sussex. Six years later he was appointed Vice-Chancellor. From 1976 to 1991 he was Provost of Worcester College, Oxford. He was Chancellor of the Open University from 1978 to 1994. In 1976 he was made a life peer. He is married with four children. His main field of historical research has been in nineteenth- and twentieth-century social and cultural history. He has also written A Social History of England, a revised edition of which appeared in 1994. He is currently President of the British Social History Society and of the Victorian Society.</p><h2>Seeing Catalonia</h2><p>Full-color photography highlights this study of the old principality of Catalonia.</p><p></p><h2>100 Hikes in Washington&#39;s North Cascades National Park Region</h2><p>The best and most authoritative hiking guide to Washington's dramatic North Cascades, now with 16 pages of color photos. <p>Complete trail descriptions with maps and photos Hikes for a variety of energy and skill levels Elevation gain, estimated hiking times, and best seasons to go </p><p>Each trip profile includes driving directions and detailed trail descriptions, with data on elevation, distance, hiking times, and seasonal considerations.

Along with reassuring repetition--&#34;He was still hungry ...&#34;--the book includes some wonderful interactive moments: what youngster can resist sticking a finger through that hole in the page as his ravenous friend makes his way through various delicacies?One sunny Sunday, the caterpillar was hatched out of a tiny egg. He was very hungry. On Monday, he ate through one apple; on Tuesday, he ate through three plums--and <i>still</i> he was hungry. Strikingly bold, colorful pictures and a simple text in large, clear type tell the story of a hungry little caterpillar's progress through an amazing variety and quantity of foods. Full at last, he made a cocoon around himself and went to sleep, to wake up a few weeks later wonderfully transformed into a butterfly!<p> Brilliantly innovative designer and artist Eric Carle has dramatized the story of one of Nature's commonest yet loveliest marvels, the metamorphosis of the butterfly, in a picture book to delight as well as instruct the very youngest reader or listener. Cleverly die-cut pages show what the caterpillar ate on successive days, graphically introducing sets of up to 10 objects and also the names of the days of the week in rotation, as well as telling the central story of the transformation of the caterpillar. The final, double-page picture of the butterfly is a joyous explosion of color, a vibrant affirmation of the wonder and beauty of Nature.</p></p><h2>Sam in the Crimea: A Victorian adventure based on the Crimean War</h2><p>Join Sam Clarke and Carrots the donkey as they stowaway on board a ship bound for the Crimea and Sams father, Colonel Hopwood.

He has written a number of physics and engineering textbooks. Since retirement he has taught parttime at a university. In the early 1980s, while attending a Shaftesbury Mission, he wrote a number of plays on Christian themes. The first of these, a short drama called John Pounds, Ragged School Pioneer, inspired him to write a fulllength musical, The Shaftesbury Story, on the career of the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury. Since then, he has had an ambition to bring the work of Shaftesbury to a wider public.</p><h2>A Scanner Darkly</h2><p>A haunting graphic version of one of Philip K. Dick&#x20ac;&#x2122;s most popular and best-selling novels. Bob Arctor is a dealer of the lethally addictive drug Substance D, which he also takes in massive quantities. Fred is the police agent assigned to tail and eventually bust him. What Fred doesn&#x20ac;&#x2122;t know is that Substance D gradually splits the user&#x20ac;&#x2122;s brain into two distinct, combative entities, and that he is, in fact, in frantic pursuit of himself. A Scanner Darkly is caustically funny and razor sharp in its depiction of drug-induced paranoia and madness; it&#x20ac;&#x2122;s an industrial-strength stress test of identity as unnerving as it is riveting. The novel is captured in this brilliant graphic vision, composed entirely of stills from the movie. Writer/Director Richard Linklater shot a live-action film, starring Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Woody Harrelson, and Winona Ryder, and then animated over the underlying images. The result is an eerily lifelike,</p><p>Mind- and reality-bending drugs factor again and again in Philip K. Dick's hugely influential SF stories. <i>A Scanner Darkly</i> cuts closest to the bone, drawing on Dick's own experience with illicit chemicals and on his many friends who died from drug abuse. Nevertheless, it's blackly farcical, full of comic-surreal conversations between people whose synapses are partly fried, sudden flights of paranoid logic, and bad trips like the one whose victim spends a subjective eternity having all his sins read to him, in shifts, by compound-eyed aliens. (It takes 11,000 years of this to reach the time when as a boy he discovered masturbation.) The antihero Bob Arctor is forced by his double life into warring double personalities: as futuristic narcotics agent "Fred," face blurred by a high-tech scrambler, he must spy on and entrap suspected drug dealer Bob Arctor. His disintegration under the influence of the insidious Substance D is genuine tragicomedy. For Arctor there's no way off the addict's downward escalator, but what awaits at the bottom is a kind of redemption--there are more wheels within wheels than we suspected, and his life is not entirely wasted. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>&#x201c;Dick is Thoreau plus the death of the American dream.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roberto Bola�o<br><br>Bob Arctor is a junkie and a drug dealer, both using and selling the mind-altering Substance D. Fred is a law enforcement agent, tasked with bringing Bob down. It sounds like a standard case. The only problem is that Bob and Fred are the same person. Substance D doesn&#x2019;t just alter the mind, it splits it in two, and neither side knows what the other is doing or that it even exists. Now, both sides are growing increasingly paranoid as Bob tries to evade Fred while Fred tries to evade his suspicious bosses.<br> In this award-winning novel, friends can become enemies, good trips can turn terrifying, and cops and criminals are two sides of the same coin. Dick is at turns caustically funny and somberly contemplative, fashioning a novel that is as unnerving as it is enthralling.<br><br>Over a career that spanned three decades, Philip K. Dick (1928&#x2013;1982) wrote 121 short stories and 45 novels, establishing himself as one of the most visionary authors of the twentieth century. His work is included in the Library of America and has been translated into more than twenty-five languages. Eleven works have been adapted to film, including <i>Blade Runner</i> (based on <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>), <i>Total Recall</i><i>,</i> <i>Minority Report</i><i>,</i> and <i>A Scanner Darkly</i><i>.</i><br><br></p><h2>At the Back of the North Wind: Complete and Unabridged</h2><p>At the Back of the North Wind is a children&#39;s book by George MacDonald. It was serialized in the children&#39;s magazine Good Words for the Young beginning in 1868 and was published in book form in 1871. It is a fantasy centered on a boy named Diamond and his adventures with the North Wind. Diamond travels together with the mysterious Lady North Wind through the nights. The book includes the fairy tale Little Daylight, which has been pulled out as an independent work, or separately, added to other collections of his fairy tales.The book tells the story of a young boy named Diamond. He is a very sweet little boy who makes joy everywhere he goes. He fights despair and gloom and brings peace to his family. One night, as he is trying to sleep, Diamond repeatedly plugs up a hole in the loft (also his bedroom) wall to stop the wind from blowing in. However, he soon finds out that this is stopping the North Wind from seeing through her window. Diamond befriends her, and North Wind lets him fly with her, taking him on several adventures. Though the North Wind does good deeds and helps people, she also does seemingly terrible things. On one of her assignments, she must sink a ship. Yet everything she does that seems bad leads to something good. The North Wind seems to be a representation of Pain and Death working according to God&#39;s will for something good.</p><p>This is a story of a poor stable boy living in Victorian London in which everyday lives are mysteriously enveloped by a power and a glory, personified here as a beautiful woman known as the North Wind. She visits the small boy, Diamond, and takes him with her on her journeys, teaching him about herself. Through the eyes of an innocent and yet perceptive child, MacDonald explores North Wind as a way of exploring the place of death in our lives. He looks squarely at social injustice--he knew poverty and the poor first hand--and yet also sees that the deepest need we have is for love and forgiveness, which are rooted in eternity.<p> This is a book for children--I've read it to my own daughter more than once--even though they may not understand just who North Wind is until years later. Adults on the other hand will learn that while they thought they knew something about death, there is much to relearn--and probably the most important part. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>A Victorian fairy tale that has enchanted readers for more than a hundred years: the magical story of Diamond, the son of a poor coachman, who is swept away by the North Wind?a radiant, maternal spirit with long, flowing hair?and whose life is transformed by a brief glimpse of the beautiful country ?at the back of the north wind.? It combines a Dickensian regard for the working class of mid-19th-century England with the invention of an ethereal landscape, and is published here alongside Arthur Hughes?s handsome illustrations from the original 1871 edition.</p><h2>Redneck Woman: Stories from My Life</h2><p>A &#34;New York Times&#34; bestseller, this memoir recounts an all-American success story, as Gretchen Wilson shares her childhood memories, her exploits along the road to the top, inspirations, fashion preferences, and more, in an open, honest, and hilarious memoir that will enchant new and old fans alike.</p><p>Gretchen Wilson lives with her daughter in Nashville, TN.</p><h2>Mexican Cookbook: A Practical Guide to Preparing and Cooking Delicious Mexican Meals</h2><p>Used.

It tells about the philosophy, history, and the practical form of the eternal tradition of <i>raganuga</i> style of devotion to God in Supreme Divine form, Radha Krishn, as described in the Upnishads, the Bhagwatam and in the writings of other historical Masters of Vrindaban, India.<p>The supreme form of God, the kinds and classes of Saints, the absolute state of the Blissful superiority of various forms and abodes of God in a progressive manner, the Divine secret of the descension of Krishn on the earth planet, the ultimate secret of the creation, the philosophies of all the Jagadgurus along with the Shat Sandarbh of Jeev Goswami, the Divine sovereignty of Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani, the description of Barsana Dham and the devotional guidelines for a devotee of Radha Krishn are the main topics of this book, which, if correctly understood and positively followed, will enable you to experience the Grace of Shree Maharajji and bring you closer to Radha Krishn.</p></p><p>His Divinity Swami Prakashanand Saraswati, (Shree Swamiji) was born in January, 1929 on <i>saphala ekadashi</i>, in a religious and respectable Brahman family of Ayodhya, India. Since his childhood he longed for Radha Krishn and desired to go to Vrindaban. Keeping his devotional feelings deep in his heart, Shree Swamiji continued his formal studies. At the age of 21, in 1950, he renounced the world and went to Joshimath in the Himalayas and then in 1951 he took the order of sanyas. In 1952, he was offered to be the successor of Jagadguru Shankaracharya of Joshimath, one of the most renowned religious thrones of India. He very politely refused by saying that his final desire is to go to Vrindaban and that he has given his life for the service of Radha Rani, so I cannot live forever in the <i>math</i>. <p> Following the strict discipline of sanyas, he lived in the Himalayas (Joshimath, Badrinath, Rishikesh, and Haridwar, etc.), the forests of Amarkantak, near the Narbada river, and other holy places. Shree Swamiji decided to go to Vrindaban to fulfill his long awaited desire to be in the abode of Radha Rani. When he entered Vrindaban he felt at home. While staying there Swamiji studied the life history of Chaitanya Mahaprabhuji and learned about his ecstatic revelations of Hari-bol.</p><p> After some time, Shree Swamiji desired to go to Barsana, the abode of Radha Rani. There a devotee told him about Shree Kripaluji Maharaj (Shree Maharajji). Immediately Swamiji left to meet Shree Maharajji. He saw everything in Shree Maharajji that he had read about Chaitanya Mahaprabhuji. After about 6 months, with the will of Shree Maharajji, Swamiji came back to Barsana where he stayed for the next 16 years. He also lived in the isolated leela places of Govardhan and Kamban and many other places in Braj. Devotees who met Shree Swamiji at that time, always found him absorbed in the thoughts of Radha Rani.</p><p> Later on Swamiji started giving discourses on <i>raganuga bhakti</i> (divine-love-consciousness). He decided to spread the message of <i>raganuga bhakti</i> and formed the organzation, now called Jagadguru Kripalu Parishat.</p><p> From 1964 to 1969 he gave discourses in India and in early 1971 he decided to spread the Divine message of Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj in an organized way. In 1972 he traveled to Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Fiji, New Zealand and in 1978 he came to U.S. </p><p> In 1990, Shree Swamiji began the establishment of Barsana Dham and the Shree Raseshwari Radha Rani Temple. The ashram and temple complex, one of the largest in the U.S., is located on 240 acres of scenic grounds in the Hill Country near Austin, TX. He also established major centers of Hindu worship and religion in Barsana and Vrindaban, India. </p><p> Shree Swamiji s state of devotional absorbment is quite evident. He is humble and forgiving. Although he teaches devotion to Radha Krishn, he has regard for all the religions and all the Saints who have shown the true path of devotion to God. </p><p> His knowledge about the Divine science of the scriptures is unequalled. He is the first person who has bridged the long-lived gap between religion and modern science, and has scientifically brought them together which is evident in his writings. </p><p> His books are unique examples of his exceeding knowledge related to the science of the material and the Divine dimensions. He is so simple that he is the friend of every soul desiring God realization.</p><p></p>It is astonishing to find Shree Swamiji s penetrating perception of the complexities of human nature and the marvellous manner in which he co-relates the teachings of all of our ancient scriptures (the Vedas, the Puranas, the Upnishads, the Brahm Sutra and the Gita). His masterly exposition that the actions of God are beyond human reasoning and what may often appear to be faulty or mistaken are only God s way of showering Grace upon mankind, is unique and enchanting. <p>His message, though rooted in deep philosophy, is marked by clarity and simplicity and is pragmatic. We need the teachings of Shree Swamiji. --Justice Ram Nandan Prasad New Delhi, India</p></p><h2>Lift the Flap Shapes</h2><p>There are a number of essential skills which children need to master before they begin school in order to have the best possible start, and being able to differentiate between and name different shapes is one of them.

A wide variety of techniques and glazes are presented, from celadons and tekmokus to the more specialized tea dust and hare's fur.</p><p><i>Oriental Glazes</i> is an instructive guide that emphasizes firing in a flame kiln (using gas, oil, propane, or wood), with the oxygen supply restricted at the top end of the firing. This creates the reducing effect that brings about the changes, especially to the metallic coloring oxides copper and iron, that produce the subtle and beautiful qualities associated with the classic Far Eastern glazes.</p><p>This clear and practical volume offers a starting point for beginners and a rich source of recipes and approaches to the established potter. With his logical, organized format and encouraging tone, Bailey's handbook is a clear and comprehensive guide on how to produce these striking glazes today.</p></p><p>Michael Bailey is a partner at Bath Potters Supplies.

John McFarland (uncle to Wesley, Kurt, Lisa and Mary) and his long lost Eleanor were getting married. But a typhoon kept nearly every one of their friends and family from attending the wedding ceremony in Hong Kong. And by the time everyone did arrive for the reception at a downtown hotel, John and Eleanor had disappeared without a trace! While their parents and the Hong Kong authorities set about searching for the missing couple, Mary, Wesley, Kurt and Lisa begin their own investigation. Convinced that John and Eleanor have been transported to the mystical kingdom of Anthropos, the four amateur sleuths hit a dead end. How can they get to Anthropos? And once they get there, how will they know where to look? As Book 5 in John White&#39;s Archives of Anthropos unfolds, the sleuths are confronted with an even bigger challenge than finding Uncle John and Eleanor. In Anthropos an evil sorcerer plots the destruction of his eternal enemy--a tiny infant who (if he survives) is destined to become King of Anthropos and conqueror of Lord Lunacy.</p><p>John White was born in Liverpool, England, on March 5, 1924, and grew up in Manchester.

The fluid relationship between these beings and humans is a central theme of this rich and accessible study of popular Hinduism in the context of the society of contemporary India. Lucidly organized and skillfully written, The Camphor Flame brings clarity to an immensely complicated subject. C. J. Fuller combines ethnographic case studies with comparative anthropological analysis, and draws on textual and historical scholarship as well. The book begins with an analysis of namaskara--the graceful gesture with which Hindus greet and show respect to gods and goddesses and to social superiors in the human world. Hierarchy is at the heart of Hinduism and Indian society, and Fuller examines the many contexts in which unequal relationships between deities and people, and among people themselves, are expressed--or denied--in popular religion. Throughout he proposes new ways of looking at many aspects of popular Hinduism and society in India, such as the relationship between worship and sacrifice, the importance of kingship even at the local level, the place of devotionalism in popular religion, the ritual power of goddesses and women, the connection between alternative explanations of misfortune, and the common basis of rituals that range from the most complicated to the simple showing of a single camphor flame to a god or goddess.</p></p><p><b>C.

For that matter, why does so much scientific literature compare poorly with, say, the phone book? After struggling with questions like these for years, biologist Richard Dawkins has taken a wide-ranging view of the subjects of meaning and beauty in <i>Unweaving the Rainbow</i>, a deeply humanistic examination of science, mysticism, and human nature. Notably strong-willed in a profession of bet-hedgers and wait-and-seers, Dawkins carries the reader along on a romp through the natural and cultural worlds, determined that "science, at its best, should leave room for poetry."<p> Inspired by the frequently asked question, "Why do you bother getting up in the morning?" following publication of his book <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, Dawkins set out determined to show that understanding nature's mechanics need not sap one's zest for life. Alternately enlightening and maddening, <i>Unweaving the Rainbow</i> will appeal to all thoughtful readers, whether wild-eyed technophiles or grumpy, cabin-dwelling Luddites. Excoriations of newspaper astrology columns follow quotes from Blake and Shakespeare, which are sandwiched between sparkling, easy-to-follow discussions of probability, behavior, and evolution. In Dawkins's world (and, he hopes, in ours), science <i>is</i> poetry; he ends his journey by referring to his title's author and subject, maintaining that "A Keats and a Newton, listening to each other, might hear the galaxies sing." <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Richard Dawkins taught zoology at the University of California at Berkeley and at Oxford University and is now the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he has held since 1995. Among his previous books are The Ancestor&#x2019;s Tale, The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow, and A Devil&#x2019;s Chaplain. Dawkins lives in Oxford with his wife, the actress and artist Lalla Ward.</p><h2>A Sportsman&#39;s Sketches</h2><p>The first work by Ivan Turgenev to attain wide attention, A Sportsman&#39;s Sketches is a collection of short stories mostly set amid Russia&#39;s rural population of serfs and peasants. Written by Turgenev in response to the stark poverty and injustices he witnessed in Russia, the stories here depict various encounters with peasants, while the narrator himself remains unseen. Each different tale illustrates a different injustice, with characters often ordinary peasants scraping a living off the land. Others, such as the dwarf Kasyan, combine a love of folklore with a distaste for the society they live and work within. Some peasants are kindly and popular, while others are thrifty and wise - in spite of their shared circumstances, Turgenev paints a picture of a countryside which contained both arable beauty and social neglect. Although some of Turgenev&#39;s stories are short anecdotes which state a simple point before concluding, others colourfully expound upon their subjects and environment.</p><p></p><h2>Birthday Girl</h2><p><p>From <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Penelope Douglas comes a new forbidden-love story....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Jordan:</p> <p>He took me in when I had nowhere else to go.

This is the story of Helen Gee&#39;s efforts to open Limelight and her fight to keep it afloat for seven years. The major figures in photography appear in this story - Edward Steichen, Robert Frank, W. Eugene Smith, Berenice Abbott, and others - and so do the big events of the period: the opening of The Family of Man, the publication of The Americans. Gee has her own personal stories as well, raising her Asian American daughter alone, dealing with a landlord with underworld ties and bookies who did business in the hall of her apartment house, and coping with unwelcome advances, quixotic employees, and suicidal photographers. This is also a portrait of a time when Greenwich Village was a center of creative activity, when actors, writers, painters, and photographers were part of a burgeoning coffeehouse scene.</p><p></p><h2>Ideas That Changed the World</h2><p>Very informational hardcover book.</p><p></p><h2>The Johns Hopkins Consumer Guide to Drugs: The Definitive Home Reference to Prescription and Over-the-Counter Medications</h2><p>This book is the most current, best-organized, and authoritative directory on medications available today.

Other ideas include creating olfactory memories by planting flowers during Advent and watching them grow and praying using a homemade &#x2018;Twelve days of Christmas&#x2019;&nbsp;calendar. On Christmas, go to church, light white candles, and bring simple gifts, such as leaves, twigs, and notes, to the manger under the tree to recall Christ&#x2019;s gift to the world.

A few keep saying that one of these days they will write a story, a novel, or a memoir, implying that this task will be simple once they get around to it. That leaves those of us who regularly fool around&#x2014;or make ourselves miserable&#x2014;with sentences in which an imaginary person&#x2014;or a real or sort of real person whom, at present, we are imagining&#x2014;does something, sentences like "I opened the door." Or maybe, we decide, "The door, as I opened it . . ." or "Opening-in a hurry-the door . . ."<br><br> We may not remember how this odd practice began&#x2014;putting human beings on the page and making them suffer and fear, making them love, discovering that they are about to do something we never thought they might. Like sexual longing, the wish to write&#x2014;to make any art&#x2014;starts in the body and precedes coherent thought about it. We want to hold a pen, or to type. Our fingers tingle; they are full of words. We have an itch, a yen, and the world tells us what our desire is called and whether it's one of the allowable kinds of wanting in our particular culture. Writing is closer to sex than we sometimes think, and for the susceptible, making sentences they like, at least for the moment ("Trembling, I opened the door, and just outside . . .") may induce arousal. Making up&#x2014;or remembering&#x2014;story is alluring and dangerous, even subversive: although writing is legal, it's disturbing to people uncomfortable with the ownership of an imagination, and some will do all they can to keep us from it, even if we are people they love. Writers of fiction and memoir, more than writers of fact, must defend&#x2014;sometimes fiercely&#x2014;their art and the time they give it. (And it's even worse for poets.)<br><br> As shocking as narrative-writing that tells a story-may be, however, this is a book about it, about those phrases and sentences we fret over ("Until I had opened the door . . ."). Fiction&#x2014;sheer invention&#x2014;may be most unsettling to unimaginative people: the lifelike nature of unreal people can be downright alarming. But the process of writing memoir isn't so different. When the memory comes, or the realization comes&#x2014;"Here I must write down what Uncle Steve did!"&#x2014;it is almost as surprising to the writer, as mysterious, as it would be if Uncle Steve weren't real.<br><br> Even before we want to make up narrative, we may find we love the sound and feel of story, its texture against our minds. As a college freshman I read James Joyce&#x2019;s story &#x201c;A Painful Case.&#x201d; The main character, Mr. Duffy, is a Dublin bachelor who writes, adding sentences now and then to a manuscript that we sense goes nowhere. He is incurably lonely: when he makes a friend, he becomes so frightened that he ends the connection, and the story is about his belated understanding that his withdrawal was wrong and harmful. He is not someone to emulate, except possibly for his moment of insight at the end. But at the beginning of the story, we learn that he &#x201c;had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense,&#x201d; and when I first read this story, I was more struck by that sentence than by anything else. I too composed such sentences, also in the third-person past tense. I secretly narrated parts of my life to myself, as if I lived in the unexciting parts of a novel, the transitions in which characters get dressed or walk to the bus stop. Like a child realizing that others have heard of masturbation and even named it, I was amazed to learn that anyone else had this &#x201c;odd autobiographical habit&#x201d; or knew about it, and I wondered if Joyce had it too&#x2014;if it meant I might be a writer. I&#x2019;ve since discovered that when I mention my own reaction to that sentence to other writers, many will smile, flushing with pleasure and self-consciousness.<br><br> Maybe Mr. Duffy's sentences are "short" because he's ambivalent about his imagination; perhaps Joyce meant that Mr. Duffy sticks to simple facts when he narrates his life to himself, and the sentences he thinks are something like "He ate his dinner." He's a rigid person who can't let himself live the freer life he is drawn to. For better or worse, my inward sentences, when I was a child, weren't short or truthful. "She carried the plate from the cupboard," I might begin, but then I'd go on, giving my life an old-fashioned, literary flavor, "and gently set the simple earthenware dish with its chipped glaze on the scarred wooden table"&#x2014;revising my mother's Danish Modern stoneware and Formica-topped aluminum kitchen set.<br><br> Whatever Mr. Duffy used his "odd autobiographical habit" for, I told my life to myself to pretend I was not just writing or reading a novel, but in one: I gave myself a narrated life. I think I wanted my actual life to be describable in the way that fictional lives may be described: I wanted it to suit the alert, androgynous, slightly acid tone of a sympathetic but sharp-eyed narrator, moral yet subtle, who observes and presents characters who may be flawed and confused but are worthy of our attention. It's a tone perfected in the British Isles, especially toward the end of the nineteenth century and in the first decades of the twentieth:<br><br> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood&#x2014;(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a fish)&#x2014;and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles.<br><br>&#x2014;from <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, by Lewis Carroll, 1865<br><br> At lunch her brother, seeing her inclined for silence, insisted on talking. Tibby was not ill-natured, but from babyhood something drove him to do the unwelcome and the unexpected. Now he gave her a long account of the day-school that he sometimes patronised. The account was interesting, and she had often pressed him for it before, but she could not attend now, for her mind was focussed on the invisible.<br><br>&#x2014;from <i>Howards End</i>, by E. M. Forster, 1910<br><br> Running below the beat and braying of the music was the steady needle-scratch on the gramophone record. Each sound had another underlying sound. She felt that if she could concentrate she would unpeel the outer sounds from the inner one, the one now buried, the last sound before complete silence&#x2014;the tick of the blood in her wrist, she thought, turning her hand on the chair; the voice of her own mind.<br><br>&#x2014;from <i>A Game of Hide and Seek</i>, by Elizabeth Taylor, 1951<br><br> When I began writing fiction I had no idea how to do it. I loved fiction's capacity to depict subtle shifts in awareness and scrupulous ethical distinctions; action without interior life had no lure. However, all I had was my love of how narrative can reveal the inner life. Even after writing poems, after studying literature, after making up narrative sentences like Joyce's Mr. Duffy, I was stuck. I had no subject matter, no ready tales to tell. I hadn't lived much&#x2014;hadn't been a bartender or a taxi driver or a merchant marine. I'd been a student, a camp counselor, a teacher, and a mother. One summer I'd been a salesclerk at Macy's. It would take me years to have the nerve to fake what I hadn't experienced.<br><br> My education wasn't bad for a writer. I had learned to think about words, to hear their sounds. I wouldn't forget that writing is composed of words, not feeling or experience. And I didn't make the mistake some new writers make, imagining that if something worth writing about happened at 2 p.m. on Monday, the words that come to mind somehow are "2 p.m. on Monday," that the event has been reproduced, so if a reader says, "This doesn't seem real," the writer can say smugly, "But it happened."<br><br> I knew about words, and a few other things. I knew that writing must be ambitious if it is to be any good: it must concern itself with what matters most. And I knew that often the sharply observed, objective detail, presented with understatement and maybe even irony, can convey feeling at least as effectively as the effusive abstract outburst.<br><br> But though I'd read plenty of it, I had failed to notice what narrative was. What I loved most&#x2014;the inner life on the page&#x2014;was real, at least in stories that centered on character rather than action, which would inevitably be the kind I'd prefer. But I hadn't noticed that narrative is not just about interior life, that even when the action in a story, novel, or memoir would not interest a police officer or a military strategist, it is still action. The genius of narrative is not just to describe interior states but to embody them-to find an equivalent for them in the visible world. A woman who, in real life, might simply think envious thoughts about a friend's good fortune, in a story drops the coveted valuable object down a storm drain, and the moment when she pauses to flick her hair off her face, loosening her grip on the borrowed antique silver bracelet, makes us know and feel her rage. The novelist may invent the dropping of the bracelet; the memoirist may recall something that happened, something that will represent the emotion. All the inwardness that I loved notwithstanding, narrative is first (not always, of course) about the tangible.<br><br> But for years my characters did little more than think and feel. It had taken me decades to stop focusing on myself and be interested enough in other people to invent characters at all. Learning to play in the world, to use its capacities when I made up story, came still more slowly.<br><br> Also, I didn't know what a contemporary story might be like. However much I loved James Joyce and Henry James, as a late-twentieth-century Jewish woman from Brooklyn, I wouldn't write stories that sounded like theirs. I'd read little contemporary fiction and almost no stories or autobiographical essays; I believed that short stories were intellectual exercises with little surprises at the end that I wouldn't know how to come up with. Now, decades later, I learn each time I read Joyce's, James's, or any other good writer's stories, but then I needed models I could connect to more directly. Nowadays I often suggest that students read writers who have written about the places where they grew up, or the ethnic group they belong to, or the kind of life they've led-immigrant life, for example. It's important to read widely and deeply, all kinds of books&#x2014;but it's also important to realize (it may come as a shock) that your own neighborhood and history, the particular way your aunt cooked vegetables, could go into your writing. Don't limit yourself to your own experience ("Write what you know" is only sometimes good advice; "Write what you don't know" is equally good)&#x2014;but don't assume that your own experience is too humble and boring for fiction.<br><br> As for me, browsing in bookstores, I at last came upon the stories of Tillie Olsen and Grace Paley. And in them ordinary people&#x2014;urban women, sometimes urban Jewish feminist women like me&#x2014;managed their lives despite the difficulties caused by ambivalence, divided loyalties, moral quandaries, and inner contradiction, not to mention poverty, prejudice, war, and the inevitable conflicts between private life and life in society. Maybe things did happen, after all, in lives like the ones I knew. Seeing that stories could talk about what mattered to me&#x2014;to a woman with kids, a woman past first youth, an urban American woman&#x2014;was the first step toward finding tone and subject matter.<br><br><i> Controlled Daydreaming</i><br><br> Writing anything&#x2014;even if it's rational and factual&#x2014;involves guesswork, intuition, and imagination. Something indefinable tells the journalist to talk to the short soldier before approaching the tall one; hunches guide the writer of science or history. Memoirists must also make choices they can't always explain about when to begin, what to emphasize, whom to leave out. The fiction writer, in addition, has the freedom to create people and events out of nothing, whether part of a story comes from life or not. Even when fiction writers start from a real incident, we change endings, compress people and events, and make up what we don't remember. The imaginative possibilities when you haven't sworn to tell the truth and nothing but the truth are dazzling. The essence of fiction is not that it isn't true but that it might not be true: it's a house with an open back door into which anything may come ("I opened the back door . . .").<br><br> The writer of fiction must be on particularly friendly terms with the unpredictable, welcoming the illogical way ideas come, the painful and embarrassing thoughts that pass through an unguarded mind.<br><br> Setting out to write narrative, whether it's fiction or memoir, we make an agreement with ourselves to live&#x2014;in part&#x2014;irrationally, to honor impulse and hunches. We must follow whatever route leads us to the unprotected part of the self, from which good writing comes. And whatever we discover about the writing we do, we must never let ourselves confuse it with something accessible to directions and rules and methodologies.<br><br> But if good writing is mysterious, illogical, and contradictory&#x2014;if it comes from what's most essential and un-sorted-out in our minds&#x2014;then how is it possible for us to learn how to produce it or to help others learn? We don't want to kill it with methods and rules, but the solution can't be to wait for inspiration, to proceed haphazardly. We've all met writers who do that&#x2014;"I just write from my heart," they say&#x2014;and it leads to clich� and formlessness. A few people write well without much effort, but I am not one of them, and you may not be either.</p><h2>My Highland Rebel (Highland Trouble, 2)</h2><p><p><strong>Second in a passionate, fast-paced Scottish Highlander romance series from critically acclaimed author Amanda Forester </strong></p><p><strong>A conquering hero</strong><br>Cormac Maclean would rather read than rampage, but his fearsome warlord father demands that he prove himself in war.

Few agree on toe length, heel length, relative heel position to frog . . . relative lengths of the medial and lateral heels, front heels versus hind heels . . . on and on. Moreover, this widespread technical disparity continues endlessly by breed, competition, gait, and even hoof color! The wild horse model is clear, however, that there shouldn't be this type of incongruity at all. Nature has demonstrated unequivocally what the relationships are between the toe, quarters, heels and other structures of the capsule. Balancing the hoof, therefore, should never be left to chance, even with the most deformed hooves. Indeed, the complexities of capsule wryness, slipper toe, bull-nose, club foot, and under trimmed heels require that we have a clear path to balancing the hoof whatever its unnatural orientation. The Hoof Balancer provides us with a quick, easy, accurate, and efficient way to balance the hoof based on the wild hoof model. It is recommended for use by all hoof care practitioners in the field, particularly when confronted with extreme capsule deformity.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Hills of Tuscany</h2><p>The author chronicles his and his wife&#39;s first five years in Tuscany, in a memoir by turns buoyant, reflective, and humorous</p><p>A sensuous valentine to author Ferenc M�t�'s adopted homeland, <i>The Hills of Tuscany</i> brims with lush descriptions of golden dales, scrumptious meals, rich wines, and friendly natives. After years of nomadic roaming from Central America to Canada, M�t� (a writer) and his wife, Candace (a painter), visit Tuscany and impulsively decide that <i>this</i> is where they will settle down. A year later they return and begin the hunt for their dream house. As the likeable M�t�s (they're funny and suitably grateful for the chance to live in one of the world's garden spots) troll the countryside with a series of colorful Tuscan middlemen, it's impossible not to become emotionally involved in their quest. And when they finally discover the perfect abode--<i>La Marinaia</i>, a tastefully renovated stone farmhouse set amid scenery that Ferenc describes as "like being in the middle of a painting"--you're thrilled right along with them. Subsequent chapters follow the M�t�s' growing friendship with their neighbors, who not only help rototill the garden but also reveal where to find porcini mushrooms and truffles in the nearby woods. All in all, reading <i>The Hills of Tuscany</i> is the next best thing to quitting your job, climbing on a plane, and finding your own Tuscan dream house. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i>Ferenc M�t� is the author of 15 books translated into 12 languages, including New York Times Notable Book A Vineyard in Tuscany and the Dugger/Nello historical sea adventure fiction series.

As her twin children are born, joining her in her work, all nature comes to life -- soil, trees, birds, animals, rivers, and the seasons. Simple, yet profound in its imagery, the story explains how there are two minds in the universe -- one that is hard and one that is gentle -- and how we ourselves are all children of the woman who fell from the sky.John Bierhorst's many books on Latin American folklore &amp; mythology include "The Mythology of South America", "The Mythology of Norther America" &amp; "The Mythology of Mexico &amp; Central America".

Between 1919 and 1960, she starred in over fifty movies, sharing billing with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Marlene Dietrich and Werner Oland. Her life, though, is the prototypical story of an immigrant's difficult path through the prejudices of American culture. Born in Los Angeles in 1905, she was the second daughter of six children born to a laundryman and his wife. Her life there fuelled her fascination with Hollywood and, in 1919 she secured a small part in her first film, <i>The Red Lantern</i>. Her most famous film roles were in <i>Thief of Baghdad, Old San Francisco</i> and <i>Shanghai Express</i>. Discrimination against Asians, though, was commonplace and when it came time to make a film version of Pearl Buck's <i>The Good Earth</i>, she was passed over for the role that was ultimately given to the Luise Rainer. In a narrative that recalls both the pathos of life in Los Angeles's Chinese neighborhoods and the glamour of Hollywood's pleasure palaces, Graham Hodges recounts the life of a Hollywood legend.<br></p><p>One of the first and best known Chinese American actresses in the history of Hollywood, Anna May Wong starred in over fifty movies between 1919 and 1960. She shared equal billing with such luminaries as Douglas Fairbanks, Sr. and Marlene Dietrich. Born in Los Angeles in 1905, Wong was the second daughter of six children born to a laundryman and his wife. Growing up in Los Angeles fuelled her fascination with Hollywood, and in 1919, she managed to secure a small part in The Red Lantern, a Boxer Rebellion drama. Her most famous film roles were in Thief of Baghdad, Old San Francisco, and most of all, Shanghai Express opposite Dietrich. But when it came time to make a film version of Pearl Buck's The Good Earth, she was passed over for the role that was made for an Asian actress, yet ultimately given to Luise Rainer. Despite Wong's successes, such instances of overt racism plagued her career.

She serves as coeditor of Rowman &amp; Littlefield&#x2019;s African American History Series, as well as director of Ball State's African-American Studies Program.<br>African Americans have served in virtually every US war from the Revolution to the present. But their loyalty has not always been appreciated or rewarded. This was never more the case than during and after WW I. Historian Mjagkij (Ball State Univ.) meticulously describes the feudal world of the Jim Crow South with its sharecropping, lynching, and segregation on the eve of the war. During the war, more than 2 million African Americans reported to draft boards, and nearly 370,000 were inducted into the military. Black Americans hoped that loyalty to country and sacrifice on the battlefield would reinforce claims for equal rights once the war ended. Black soldiers served valiantly in segregated black units, but were routinely mistreated by white soldiers and subjected to atrocious conditions. African American soldiers returned home to lynchings and a wave of race riots. White supremacists such as Theodore Bilbo proclaimed 'This is strictly a white man's country,' and others insisted that the 'Negro' would have no more after the war than he had before. For African Americans, WW I was an experience of bitter betrayal. Highly recommended. All levels/libraries.

For that matter forget Silicon Valley. The first personal computer, a self-contained unit with its own programmable processor, display, keyboard, internal memory, telephone interface, and mass storage of data was born in San Antonio TX. US Patent number 224,415 was filed November 27, 1970 for a machine that is the direct lineal ancestor to the PC as we know it today. The story begins in 1968, when two Texans, Phil Ray and Gus Roche, founded a firm called Computer Terminal Corporation. As the name implies their first product was a Datapoint 3300 computer terminal replacement for a mechanical Teletype. However, they knew all the while that the 3300 was only a way to get started, and it was cover for what their real intentions were - to create a programmable mass-produced desktop computer. They brought in Jack Frassanito, Vic Poor, Jonathan Schmidt, Harry Pyle and a team of designers, engineers and programmers to create the Datapoint 2200. In an attempt to reduce the size and power requirement of the computer it became apparent that the 2200 processor could be printed on a silicon chip. Datapoint approached Intel who rejected the concept as a &#34;dumb idea&#34; but were willing to try for a development contract. Intel belatedly came back with their chip but by then the Datapoint 2200 was already in production. Intel added the chip to its catalog designating it the 8008. A later upgrade, the 8080 formed the heart of the Altair and IMSI in the mid-seventies. With further development it was used in the first IBM PC-the PC revolution&#39;s chip dynasty. If you&#39;re using a PC, you&#39;re using a modernized Datapoint 2000.</p><p></p><h2>In Freedom&#39;s Cause</h2><p>At the end of the 13th century, the oppressed Scots rebelled against England under the leadership of William Wallace and Robert Bruce.

In each case, arrests were made, suspects confessed their crime and were sentenced to life. One slightly worrying detail: all the presumed murderers lost consciousness during the night of the crime and cannot remember whether they actually did it or not. Commissaire Adamsberg is convinced all the murders are the work of one person: the terrifying Judge Fulgence. Years before, Adamsberg&#x2019;s own brother had been the principal suspect in a similar case and avoided prison only thanks to Adamsberg&#x2019;s help. History now repeats itself when Adamsberg, who is temporarily based in Quebec for a training mission, is accused of having savagely murdered his young lover. In order to prove his innocence, Adamsberg must go on the run from the Canadian police and find Judge Fulgence. The heir to Maigret, Commissaire Adamsberg is back in a new investigation that will keep the reader spellbound until the very last word.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Fred Vargas was born in Paris in 1957.

On a Saturday, October 4, when the outside temperature had dropped to one degree Celsius, as cold air had arrived from the Arctic. The <i>commissaire</i> knew nothing about heating systems, and was examining the silent tank and pipework, in the hope that his benign gaze would either restore the boiler&#x2019;s energy or perhaps conjure up the engineer, who was supposed to be there but hadn&#x2019;t turned up.<br><br>Not that he felt the cold, nor was he distressed by the situation. On the contrary, the idea that the north wind should sometimes come funnelling down from the polar ice cap to the streets of the 13th <i>arrondissement </i>of Paris gave him the sensation that he was only one step away from the frozen wastes, that he could walk across them and dig a hole to hunt seals, if he felt like it. He had put on a pullover under his black jacket, and if it was up to him, he would have waited patiently for the repairman to come, while watching for the whiskers of a seal to pop up out of the ice.<br><br>But in its own way, the powerful heating system down in the basement was a full-time participant in the handling of the cases that poured in all day long to the Paris Serious Crime Squad, as it conveyed its warmth to the thirty-four radiators and twenty-eight police officers in the building. The said officers were at present shivering with cold, huddled into anoraks and crowding round the coffee machine, warming their gloved hands on the white beakers. Or else they had simply left the building for one of the nearby bars. Their files were consequently frozen solid too. Important files, dealing with violent crimes. But the boiler wasn&#x2019;t concerned with all that. It was simply waiting, in lordly and tyrannical fashion, for the man with the magic touch to arrive and kneel in front of it. So as a gesture of goodwill, Adamsberg had gone downstairs to pay it brief and unsuccessful homage, and in particular to find a quiet dark place where he could escape from the complaints of his colleagues.<br><br>Their curses at the cold, since the inside temperature was, after all, about 10 degrees, did not augur well for the vote on the proposed DNA profiling course in Quebec, where the autumn was turning out severe &#x2014; minus 4 yesterday in Ottawa, and it was already snowing in places. They were being offered two weeks&#x2019; full-time study of genetic imprints, using saliva, blood, sweat, tears, urine and other excretions, now captured on electronic circuits, classified and broken down. All body fluids had become battleground weapons in criminology. A week before the planned departure date, Adamsberg&#x2019;s thoughts had already taken off towards the Canadian forests, which he had been told were immense and dotted with millions of lakes. His second-in-command, <i>Capitaine</i> Danglard, had reminded him crossly that they would be staring at computer screens, not gazing out over lakes. Danglard had been angry with him for a year now. Adamsberg knew why, and was waiting patiently for the grumbling to subside.<br><br>Danglard was not dreaming about lakes, but praying every day that some urgent case would keep the entire squad back home. For weeks he had been imagining his imminent death, as the plane blew up over the Atlantic. But since the heating engineer had failed to arrive, he had cheered up somewhat. He was hoping that the unforeseen breakdown of the boiler and the sudden cold snap would put paid to the absurd idea of travelling to Canada&#x2019;s icy wastes.<br><br>Adamsberg put his hand on the tank and smiled. Would Danglard have been capable of scuppering the boiler, since he was well aware that it would spread alarm and despondency? And then making sure that the technician didn&#x2019;t turn up? Yes, Danglard would have been quite capable of that. His fluid intelligence could slip into the narrowest mechanisms of the human mind. As long as the mechanisms were those of reason and logic. And it was precisely along that watershed, between reason and instinct, that Adamsberg and his deputy so diametrically differed, and had done for years.<br><br>The <i>commissaire</i> went back up the spiral staircase and crossed the large room on the ground floor where people were walking about slowly, heavy shapes bundled up in extra sweaters and scarves. Nobody knew quite why, but they called this the Council Chamber, presumably, Adamsberg thought, because of the full-scale meetings and consultations that took place there. Alongside it was the similarly named Chapter Room, where smaller gatherings were held. Where the names came from, Adamsberg did not know, but probably from Danglard, whose encyclopedic knowledge seemed to him sometimes to be unlimited, and almost toxic. The <i>capitaine</i> was capable of sudden outbursts of information, as frequent as they were uncontrollable, rather like the snorting of a horse. It could take a trifle &#x2014; an unusual word, an imperfectly formulated idea &#x2014; for him to launch into an erudite and not always well-timed lecture, which could be stopped by a warning gesture.<br><br>Shaking his head, Adamsberg communicated to the faces that looked up as he passed that the boiler was still showing no signs of life. He walked into Danglard&#x2019;s office. His deputy was finishing off various urgent reports with a gloomy air, just in case the disastrous expedition to Labrador went ahead as planned, although of course he would never reach Canada, on account of the mid-Atlantic explosion, caused by the fire in the left-hand engine, which would have been knocked out by a flock of starlings. The prospect gave him a cast-iron excuse for opening a bottle of white wine before six o&#x2019;clock. Adamsberg perched on a corner of his desk.<br><br>&#x2018;Where are we in the D&#x2019;Hernoncourt case, Danglard?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;All sewn up. The old baron has confessed.

While nuclear science improves our everyday lives&#x2014;from medicine to microwave technology&#x2014;radiation&#x2019;s invisible powers can trigger cancer and cellular mayhem. Writing with a biographer&#x2019;s passion, Craig Nelson unlocks one of the great mysteries of the universe in a work that is tragic, triumphant, and above all, fascinating.<br> <br>From the discovery of X-rays in the 1890s, through the birth of nuclear power in an abandoned Chicago football stadium, to the bomb builders of Los Alamos and the apocalyptic <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> era, Nelson illuminates a pageant of fascinating historical figures: Marie and Pierre Curie, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Franklin Roosevelt, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Harry Truman, Curtis LeMay, John F. Kennedy, Robert McNamara, Ronald Reagan, and Mikhail Gorbachev, among others. He reveals how brilliant Jewish scientists fleeing Hitler transformed America from a nation that created lightbulbs and telephones into one that split atoms; how the most grotesque weapon ever invented could realize Alfred Nobel&#x2019;s lifelong dream of global peace; and how, in our time, emergency workers and low-level utility employees fought to contain run-amok nuclear reactors while wondering if they would live or die. <br> <br>Radiance defies our common-sense views of nature, with its staggering amounts of energy flowing from seemingly inert rock and matter pulsing in half-lives that transforms into other states over the course of decades or in the blink of an eye. Radiation is as scary a word as cancer, but it&#x2019;s the power that keeps our planet warm, as well as the force behind earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, and so organic to all life that even our own human bodies are radioactive. By tracing mankind&#x2019;s complicated relationship with the dangerous energy it discovered and unleashed, Nelson reveals how atomic power and radiation are indivisible from our everyday lives.<br> <br>Brilliantly told and masterfully crafted, <i>The Age of Radiance</i> provides a new understanding of a misunderstood epoch in history and restores to prominence the forgotten heroes and heroines who have changed all of our lives for better and for worse. It confirms Craig Nelson&#x2019;s position as one of the most lively and skillful popular historians writing today.</p><p>Craig Nelson&nbsp;is the author of <i>Pearl Harbor: From Infamy to Greatness</i> and the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller, <i>Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon, </i>as well as several previous books, including <i>The Age of Radiance </i>(a PEN Award Finalist chosen as one of the year&#x2019;s best books by NBC News, the American Institute of Physics, <i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, and FlavorWire), <i>The First Heroes, Thomas Paine </i>(winner of the Henry Adams Prize), and <i>Let&#x2019;s Get Lost</i> (shortlisted for W.H.

His writing has appeared in <i>Vanity Fair, The Wall Street Journal, Salon, National Geographic, The New England Review, Popular Science, Reader&#x2019;s Digest,</i> and a host of other publications."A book that moves at a thrilling pace through the while history of the atomic age... Mr. Nelson wisely dramatizes the insights that led to understanding the nucleus by following the lives of a few physcists, each a leader in the field and each displaying remarkable traits of individuality, creativity and endurance... this ambitious book does achieve is goal, presenting a grand and very readable overview of the nuclear era." (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"Rich with powerful images ... fraught with drama ... and moments of great pathos ... a thrilling, intense, and disturbing account of the scientific and sociopolitical history of the atomic era, from the discovery of X-rays to the tragic meltdown of Japan&#x2019;s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in March 2011." (<i>Christian Science Monitor</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A page-turning history... Historian Craig Nelson tells the tale with exceptional panache... an example of top-notch storytelling... Nelson&#x2019;s version is one of the best, an ideal balance of detail, character, conflict and information...He&#x2019;s always able to find the image or observation that makes a scene or situation blossom in a reader&#x2019;s mind&#x2019;s eye. And much of what he finds is surprising.&#x201d; (<i>Salon</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A fascinating, information-rich new work... Filled with drama, vivid anecdotes, and breathtaking scientific breakthroughs, this book is an engrossing, comprehensive history of the atomic age.&#x201d; (<i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Nelson writes a wonderfully detailed, anecdote-filled account of atomic energy, from Wilhelm Roentgen&#x2019;s 1895 discovery of radiation to the ongoing hangover of the Fukushima disaster.... Other authors have covered the myriad ways this invisible power impacts our lives, but Nelson brilliantly weaves a plethora of material into one noteworthy volume.&#x201d; (<i>Publisher&#x2019;s Weekly (starred review)</i>)<br><br>"This is the kind of book that doesn&#x2019;t just inform you but leaves you feeling smarter." (<i>Dallas Morning News</i>)<br><br>"A highly readable history of humanity&#x2019;s embrace of nuclear energy and radiation." (<i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is no impersonal &#x201c;march of science&#x201d; story. The author also shows how the development of nuclear physics was deeply influenced by contemporary politics and the interplay of the personalities involved. An engaging history that raises provocative questions about the future of nuclear science.&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus (starred review)</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A sweeping panorama of the nuclear age, from Wilhelm R�ntgen&#x2019;s discovery of X-rays to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, paying particular attention to the colorful scientists whose brilliance and diligence unlocked the secrets of the atom.... Nelson tells their stories vividly, with a journalist&#x2019;s eye for symmetry and irony; the science itself is, at times, less central to his narrative than the fusion-reactions of interacting scientists and government officials.&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"Nelson's vivid reconstructions...shine. They make this book fun to read and sometimes hard to put down.'" (<i>On the Seawall</i>)</p><h2>Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle over Health Care Reform</h2><p><p>In no other country has health care served as such a volatile flashpoint of ideological conflict. America has endured a century of rancorous debate on health insurance, and despite the passage of legislation in 2010, the battle is not yet over. This book is a history of how and why the United States became so stubbornly different in health care, presented by an expert with unsurpassed knowledge of the issues.</p><p>Tracing health-care reform from its beginnings to its current uncertain prospects, Paul Starr argues that the United States ensnared itself in a trap through policies that satisfied enough of the public and so enriched the health-care industry as to make the system difficult to change.</p><p>He reveals the inside story of the rise and fall of the Clinton health plan in the early 1990s&#x2014;and of the Gingrich counterrevolution that followed. And he explains the curious tale of how Mitt Romney&#x2019;s reforms in Massachusetts became a model for Democrats and then follows both the passage of those reforms under Obama and the explosive reaction they elicited from conservatives. Writing concisely and with an even hand, the author offers exactly what is needed as the debate continues&#x2014;a penetrating account of how health care became such treacherous terrain in American politics.</p></p><p><p>What do you most want people to understand from reading this book?<br>&nbsp;I hope the book illuminates how an issue that is more or less settled in every other democracy became a seemingly intractable political problem in the United States.<br>It did not have to turn out this way. The legislation adopted in 2010 has its roots in moderate Republican proposals. But America&#x2019;s polarized politics make it difficult to see the reforms clearly and put them in historical perspective. I hope the book helps to provide that understanding.</p> <p>What&#x2019;s the relationship of <i>Remedy and Reaction</i> to your 1984 book, <i>The</i> <i>Social Transformation of American Medicine</i>?<br>&nbsp;In some ways it&#x2019;s a sequel, but each of its three parts has a somewhat different foundation.&nbsp; Part One, about how health-care reform and the health-care system took shape during the twentieth century, presents the same kind of social and historical analysis as <i>Social Transformation</i> did.<br>But Part Two, which deals with the parallel stories of the Clinton health plan and Republican health reforms in the Gingrich and Bush years, also reflects my observations inside the Clinton White House. That&#x2019;s a kind of experience not usually available to historians.<br>Finally, Part Three, about the battle over health-care reform under Obama, combines journalism and historical analysis because it draws on interviews with participants, many of whom I know from my prior time in Washington.</p> <p>Why did Obama succeed where Clinton failed?<br>&nbsp;Between 1993 and 2009, the biggest change was the emergence of a consensus about the basic elements of legislation among reformers, major interest groups, and leading Democrats in Congress. The reforms adopted in Massachusetts in 2006 as a result of Mitt Romney&#x2019;s leadership were critical in shaping that consensus.&nbsp; Obama accepted that approach; he didn&#x2019;t originate it. Romney probably deserves more credit for the basic architecture of the national reforms, and I hope one day he proudly accepts that credit.</p> <p>Didn&#x2019;t Obama&#x2019;s leadership matter?<br>If Obama hadn&#x2019;t decided to make health-care reform a priority as president, it would never have passed.&nbsp; Why did he take it on? His earlier history didn&#x2019;t indicate a deep commitment to health-care reform. I think the 2008 presidential campaign was crucial because of the pressure from the party base to confront the issue, plus an accident of history: he ran into Hillary Clinton on the way to the nomination, and debating her forced him to master health policy. Perhaps most important, the support for reform from key stakeholder groups and members of Congress changed the political calculus on health care. That&#x2019;s what made it a better bet than climate legislation.</p><b>Paul Starr</b> is professor of sociology and public affairs, Princeton University, and cofounder and coeditor of <i>The American Prospect</i>.

Government debt is skyrocketing. Currencies are collapsing. Banks are going broke. Businesses are folding. Families are struggling. We&#39;ve been stranded, sitting on top of a mountain of IOU&#39; that will never be paid off. Most professional economists don&#39;t know what to do. Neither do most professional theologians. They don&#39;t have answers. But the Bible does. In this book, Dr. Gary North outlines specifically what those answers are. He demonstrates beyond any shadow of a doubt that there is hope. If we act quickly, wisely and scripturally, we can save our nation-indeed, Western Civilization-from the most disastrous economic catastrophe in history. The Bible tells us what to do, when, where, how, and why. It offers a &#34;blueprint&#34; for financial victory. Honest Money lays out that &#34;blueprint&#34; simply, practically, and understandably. It shows us how we can &#34;move mountains.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Path Finder (The Spectrum Chronicles)</h2><p>Consuela&#39;s attempt to rescue her friend Wander, who is being held hostage, takes her on a secret mission on a renegade spaceship</p><p>size : 5.2 x 7.5</p><h2>The Equalizer: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>Michael Sloan, co-creator of the classic 1980s TV series--the basis for the feature films starring Denzel Washington--reinvents the story of the mysterious, former covert intelligence officer who helps desperate people who are in need of his unique and deadly skills.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Robert McCall is a former covert operations officer for the CIA who tries to atone for past sins by offering, free of charge, his services as a troubleshooter (often literally), a protector, and an investigator.

Michael is married to actress Melissa Anderson and they have two children, Piper and Griffin.<p>CHAPTER 1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Robert McCall stopped at the mouth of a narrow alleyway behind a row of stores on Broome Street on the edge of Greenwich Village. It was an alleyway he&#x2019;d passed a thousand times without bothering to look into it. He knew what was in it: Dumpsters overflowing with garbage, a thin carpet of debris, crushed cans and water bottles, used condoms, cigarette butts, newspapers, crumpled flyers, discarded confetti as if someone had tried to bring some color to the drab grayness. Doorways on the left led to the backs of the stores, a print shop, a greengrocers, a Chinese restaurant, a mom-and-pop grocery store. There were two iron doors on the right, warped on rusted hinges. There was a landscape of big cardboard boxes at the other end of the alleyway, jumbled up: people&#x2019;s homes.</p> <p>The black pimp wore black, so he was just a fragment of the shadows, moving erratically as his fist came down again to hit the girl&#x2019;s face. It looked as if he was going to cave in her left cheekbone. Both of her eyes were blackened. Blood was running out of her nose. The prior blow had just missed breaking it. McCall could see the raw channels around her nostrils where they were being eaten away by coke. The pimp was lean, bald, probably mid-twenties, his cutoff tight T-shirt showing tattoos up and down his arms. Serpents and mermaids. He was big, probably six-four. He shook his white hooker as if she wasn&#x2019;t listening to the tirade in his head. His jewelled hands were the only moving points of light in the dimness, his many rings and bracelets catching the pale morning sunlight that barely penetrated the alley. The girl was probably seventeen or eighteen, McCall thought. She was thin and limp, dressed in torn jeans and a halter top that the pimp had almost dragged off. A safety pin dangled from her navel. Her jeans were torn in places that revealed track marks on her legs. She was wearing sandals. Her toenails were a frosted pink. Her hair was a straggle of dirty blond seaweed over her face, but McCall could see flashes of her eyes, wide and fearful before they shut tight in anticipation of the next blow. She&#x2019;d been beaten before. He&#x2019;d seen her in the neighborhood, makeup expertly applied to cover the bruises.</p> <p>But this time it was different. She knew it and McCall knew it. Her pimp was in a blind rage over something. Maybe she&#x2019;d been holding out on him. Maybe she&#x2019;d pocketed some money from a john to go and have a glass of wine and a sandwich in an uptown bistro, just to pretend, for an hour, that her life wasn&#x2019;t a nightmare. McCall thought of her, irrationally, as a kid, running around a playground, laughing, having a tenth birthday party, a teenager Facebooking her friends, the images all coming to him in split seconds. Clich�s, he knew, but that&#x2019;s what went through his head. Then of her being older and someone putting out lines of coke, handing her a rolled-up dollar bill, go ahead, it&#x2019;s a rush, all that talk about addiction is bullshit, you control your actions. She&#x2019;d liked it. She&#x2019;d done it again. Then she&#x2019;d started shooting up. Heroin was the drug of choice again. She&#x2019;d starting turning tricks, no big deal, she liked sex. But then she realized it was not about sex, it was about need and agony and being controlled.</p> <p>None of that mattered now. It didn&#x2019;t matter to McCall. This was none of his business. He&#x2019;d been off the radar for nine months. Keeping a very low profile. She wasn&#x2019;t the first hooker he&#x2019;d seen in these streets getting a beating. And he didn&#x2019;t want to be late. He was on his way to see his son Scott. He&#x2019;d catch the 1 line at the Twenty-third Street subway station, take it to Columbus Circle. It was a short walk from there to West Sixty-second Street. He might even get off at Forty-second Street and walk. He liked walking in New York City. But this time the pimp was going to take care of business. One more blow should do it. He&#x2019;d dragged the girl up with one hand, clutching her halter top, up around her throat now, exposing her large, pendulous breasts. He was going to hit her from below. A vicious uppercut. It would drive her nose up into her brain and kill her.</p> <p>McCall stepped into the alleyway. He felt like eyes were watching him from the large cartons, but nothing moved in them. Just a light breeze rustling through the cardboard living rooms and bedrooms.</p> <p>The pimp had his fist balled up.</p> <p>Swung it back.</p> <p>McCall grabbed his wrist, yanking him away from the girl. She stumbled to her knees, trying to stem the flow of blood from her nose with the back of her hand. The pimp was in such a rage he just looked at McCall like he was a crazy man. It was a bad mistake. You&#x2019;re grabbed in an alley on your own turf, when you&#x2019;re teaching one of your whores a lesson, you don&#x2019;t let anyone stop you. Certainly not some white-ass, old dude in a suit and tie and a dark overcoat. Looked like he&#x2019;d just strolled up from Wall Street. McCall took advantage of the second&#x2019;s hesitation to kick the pimp&#x2019;s legs out from under him. He fell to his knees. McCall gripped both of his hands, twisting them back, holding him in an iron grip. The girl scrambled away, but couldn&#x2019;t get to her feet yet. Didn&#x2019;t have enough oxygen in her lungs.</p> <p>The pimp looked up at McCall, seeing Mr. Average, Mr. Nobody, maybe around forty-five, medium height, probably 180, a handsome face, soulful eyes, dark hair shot through with splinter streaks of gray. McCall held on to him as if he was stopping him from falling over.</p> <p>&#x201c;Whatever she did to you, she&#x2019;s sorry and it won&#x2019;t happen again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I swear,&#x201d; the girl gasped, choking as some of the blood pooled in her mouth. She spit it out and, as if suddenly self-conscious, pulled her halter top down over her breasts.</p> <p>&#x201c;I live in the neighborhood,&#x201d; McCall said, conversationally, as if he and the pimp were arranging to meet for coffee. &#x201c;I know the cops at the precinct. I like to chat with the guy who runs the morgue. Very erudite. Quotes Blake and Harry Potter. If I find out this girl&#x2019;s been beaten again, I&#x2019;ll come looking for you. And I&#x2019;ll find you. If you kill her, I&#x2019;ll personally deliver you onto one of the morgue&#x2019;s autopsy tables. Are we cool?&#x201d;</p> <p>The pimp nodded. Just nodded. McCall let go of his hands. Turned toward the girl, who stumbled away even more.</p> <p>It was not a mistake McCall would have made a year ago.</p> <p>He&#x2019;d read defeat in the pimp&#x2019;s eyes. But he&#x2019;d read it wrong. The guy was street-smart. Slump back, dejected, he&#x2019;ll let it go this time.</p> <p>He grabbed McCall from behind, standing in one fluid movement, a massive muscular arm crushing McCall&#x2019;s throat. He tried to plunge his thumb into McCall&#x2019;s left eye. A street move, but a stupid one. McCall grabbed the pimp&#x2019;s left hand, breaking his middle and ring fingers in two sharp movements. The strangling hold on his throat went slack. McCall grabbed the pimp&#x2019;s right hand, broke the middle and ring fingers, turned him and kicked him in the balls. He crashed to the ground, closing up into a fetal position, his legs protecting his testicles, his hands trembling as he looked down at his broken fingers.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be tough to beat up your bitches for a few weeks,&#x201d; McCall said. &#x201c;Your fingers will be in splints. But they&#x2019;ll heal.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a dead man,&#x201d; the pimp managed to croak, his voice filled with pain.</p> <p>&#x201c;If I had a nickel&#x2026;&#x201d; McCall sighed.</p> <p>He pulled the girl up to her full height, which was about five-nine. She grabbed her maroon jacket that had fallen onto one of the trash cans behind her. McCall hustled her down the alleyway, past the cardboard boxes, until they were out on Broome Street. There was a sudden rush of traffic; a bus and a couple of yellow cabs went by. The usual cacophony of impatient horns. McCall noted a uniformed cop at the corner of Broadway. He was looking their way, but he wasn&#x2019;t coming over. He continued talking to the owner of a computer store on the corner, which, judging from the stock in the windows, looked like the only merchandise it handled fell off the backs of various trucks.</p> <p>The girl took some tissues from the pocket of her jacket and pushed them up both nostrils to stop the bleeding. SOP.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; she said. Her voice was clearer. &#x201c;I think he would have killed me this time.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He would have.&#x201d;</p> <p>Closer to her, McCall saw her eyes were actually very beautiful, a hazel green. There was gratitude in them, but it was so pushed down by need it barely registered.</p> <p>&#x201c;I owe you,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Lucy. Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s your street name. What&#x2019;s your real name?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who cares? I never use it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Humor me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Margaret. Lame, huh? What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mine doesn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d;</p> <p>She moved right up to him, her voice taking on the husky quality she knew worked. &#x201c;Sure, I get it. I don&#x2019;t need to know your name. Come with me. No charge. I don&#x2019;t want to be alone. Please.&#x201d; She took his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do anything you want.&#x201d;</p> <p>She moved his hand under her halter top until it was on her left breast, then looked over at the uniformed cop on the corner. He was taking a little more notice.</p> <p>&#x201c;Can we go somewhere?&#x201d; she asked urgently. &#x201c;Your place?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to be late for my son.&#x201d; McCall said it gently and removed his hand from beneath her halter top. &#x201c;Your pimp will get his fingers strapped up. He won&#x2019;t come looking for you this afternoon. But maybe tonight. If you have friends in the city he doesn&#x2019;t know about, stay with them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know him. He&#x2019;ll track me down. You don&#x2019;t fuck with him like that. Can I stay with you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. Right now you need to go to a hospital. I&#x2019;ll flag down a cab and come with you. Make sure you get fixed up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Screw you, asshole,&#x201d; she said, tears burning in her eyes. &#x201c;You did your hero thing. I hope it made you feel real warm and runny inside.&#x201d;</p> <p>She walked away from him, down Broome Street, putting on her jacket and pulling it closed as if she was suddenly very cold.</p> <p>McCall thought briefly about going after her, forcing her into a cab with him, taking her to the nearest hospital, which was Beth Israel. But that would make him late for Scott. He could just put her into a cab, give her the money to go to the ER, but he knew she&#x2019;d jump out at the first traffic light. That money was too precious to waste on fixing up her face. She could do that herself.</p> <p>McCall looked into the alleyway, checking his back. The pimp was gone. There hadn&#x2019;t been time for him to stagger down to the other end. He must&#x2019;ve used one of the doorways now on McCall&#x2019;s left. McCall was angry with himself. He&#x2019;d broken his cardinal rule of the last nine months and stepped into a situation that had absolutely nothing to do with him. He hoped his actions wouldn&#x2019;t come back to haunt him.</p> <p>Even the cop on the corner looked at him like he was an idiot. McCall gave him a tired smile. <i>Yeah, well, some habits are hard to break.</i></p> <p>At least the girl was still alive.</p> <p>McCall turned up his collar against the bitter wind that was now blowing down Broome Street, walked past the cop, and headed up Broadway toward the subway station.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>At that exact same moment, in the bedroom of a sixth-floor Club Level suite at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel on Tverskaya Street in Moscow, Elena Petrov stood naked in front of a full-length mirror. She was a brunette, in her late thirties, tall, athletic, Russian born, but an American citizen since the age of nine. She looked at the knife scar that started under her left breast and stretched down to just above the pubic area. There was also the ragged skin tear on her right side where she&#x2019;d been shot. The bullet had only grazed her, but the reminder was still there. She had an angelic face, big brown laughing eyes, just the girl next door with a slight Russian accent, so she was always amused when an ardent lover finally got &#x201c;the gear off,&#x201d; as her British girlfriends would say, and reacted to her battle scars. She would say she&#x2019;d been mugged in New York&#x2014;the knife scar&#x2014;and shot by a boyfriend who was showing off his new Smith &amp; Wesson SD40 pistol while they were taking a romantic stroll in Le Bois de Boulogne Park in Paris.</p> <p>Neither was true.</p> <p>She picked up what looked like a long needle from a thin, plastic case on a table. She slid it into her hair and attached it with a small, dark barrette. You&#x2019;d never know the needle was there unless you were looking for it.</p> <p>She glanced out of the big picture window overlooking Red Square. Twilight was gathering fast. A light snow was falling. She could see the towers and spires of the Kremlin. Like something out of a dark fairy tale. She looked back into the mirror and noted the intruder&#x2019;s shadow darken at the ajar bedroom door. Behind it was the sitting room and the front door to the suite. She could have made a grab for her jewelled black bag on the ornate table, where her gun was. But she didn&#x2019;t. She pulled on sheer black panties and picked up a short black cocktail dress from the arm of a chair. Dropped the dress over her head, let it fall down her body, open at the back halfway down her shapely ass, clearly seen through the panties. It made her grin.</p> <p>&#x201c;You can zip me up,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;if you&#x2019;d like.&#x201d;</p> <p>A tall, elegant man in his fifties stepped into the bedroom. He was impeccably dressed in a Savile Row dark blue suit, a pink-striped shirt, gold crossed golf club cuff links, a red tie with small chess pieces on it, shoes polished until they gleamed. There was a whiff of pungent cologne as he stepped up behind Elena. She looked at his face in the mirror: handsome, a little chiseled, bright blue eyes. Usually those eyes were unreadable, the face a mask, but right now he looked distinctly embarrassed. He was actually <i>blushing</i>. Elena knew him only as Control. Everyone at The Company called him Control. She didn&#x2019;t know his real name. She didn&#x2019;t think any of the other agents did either. He was her Control on this mission, unusual for him to actually be <i>in</i> the field, but then he&#x2019;d always been a man of surprises. It was rumored he had a wife and two teenage daughters, lived in a quiet suburb of Washington, D.C., played golf with a four handicap, and drank only very aged whiskey. But that might just be the cover story.</p> <p>I guess you didn&#x2019;t hear me come in,&#x201d; Control murmured, reaching down for the zip at the bottom of her black dress.</p> <p>&#x201c;I heard you. Next time you could clear your throat.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I could have been an enemy agent sneaking up on you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not wearing that cologne. It&#x2019;s very distinctive. You buy it from a tiny shop in Mayfair in London, the only place it&#x2019;s sold. If you&#x2019;re done looking at my cute ass, you can zip me up now.&#x201d;</p> <p>Her eyes were twinkling. He zipped her up.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d you get the knife scar? The gunshot wound I know about.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I was mugged in Central Park. Not every single incident in my life is in my file. So, you&#x2019;ve had the grand tour of my body.&#x201d; She turned to face him. &#x201c;How will I look to everyone else?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Very beautiful,&#x201d; Control said. &#x201c;And you&#x2019;d never let a mugger get close enough to attack you in Central Park.&#x201d;</p> <p>She smiled and picked up the small jewelled bag that matched the dress. Took out her Beretta 21 Bobcat, checked again that it was loaded, put it back, and snapped the bag shut. Control fitted a tiny receiver in her left ear, completely undetectable.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be able to hear every word.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a scary thought.&#x201d;</p> <p>He took out a pair of slim, black-framed glasses from a metal case and handed them to her. She put them on.</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you going to escort me to the party?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Only to near the gallery. I won&#x2019;t be going inside. But I won&#x2019;t be far away.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s got my back?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Masters.

Looking to the door at my left, which led into the corridor, I imagined my guests entering and realized for the thousandth time the danger, stupidity and yet necessity of what I was doing. I was creating an explosive situation and, like lightning striking dry grass, I didn't know if I would get sparks or a wildfire.<br><br>"The time?" I asked, throat dry.<br><br>"They aren't late, if that's what you mean."<br><br>London was leaning against the wall behind me, having been reassigned as my personal bodyguard, a duty he took most seriously. Although I had been named Grand Provost of the Hytanican Province by the High Priestess, London did not trust that the Cokyrians would respect that decision, and felt I was in greater need of protection than ever before.<br><br>After much thought, I'd chosen what had been the King's Drawing Room for this meeting, believing it to be the most neutral ground. Memories and pain lurked in almost every corner of the Palace of Hytanica&#x2014;which had been redubbed the Bastion by the Cokyrians&#x2014;but this room was nondescript and held no particular significance, unlike the Hall of Kings, where the thrones of our royalty had been removed along with the portraits of rulers past; unlike the strategy room where we had planned our last defenses; unlike the offices that had formerly been Steldor's as King, Cannan's as the Captain of the Guard and Galen's as Sergeant at Arms.<br><br>This would be the first time since the occupation that the most influential men of my kingdom would come face-to-face with Narian, the Commander of the Cokyrian Forces. These were the men who had delivered me to safety during the attack and who had proved their valor again and again while we'd grappled for leverage from our hiding place in the caves of the Nineyre Mountains. And Narian was the man I loved, who had operated under duress, for the Overlord had held my sister's life in his hands; he had bargained with the warlord, done all he could to save our troops and our people, but still wounds were raw among my fellows. Cannan's beloved brother Baelic had been tortured to death by the Overlord merely for his relation to the captain. London and Halias, deputy captains in the Elite Guard and bodyguards to my sister and me, had suffered "more than they would ever say," by the warlord's own claim; and Destari, another faithful deputy captain, had been slain before London's eyes. I could not blame my friends for their bitterness, nor deny my own, though mine was not directed at Narian.<br><br>At long last, the door I had been watching opened and the Hytanican men entered: Cannan and Steldor, so alike with their formidable builds, dark eyes and nearly black hair, although Steldor's features were otherwise those of his beautiful mother; Galen, slightly lighter in coloring than his best friend, his generally more forgiving nature eradicated by the war; and Halias, whose twinkling blue eyes seemed harder and whose sandy hair was cut short, physical signs of the loss of his easygoing manner.<br><br>All bowed before me, to my chagrin referring to me as Queen Alera, before sharing nods with London that bespoke of the respect the men held for each other.<br><br>"You should not call me Queen," I reminded them, keeping my volume low, always conscious these days that someone might overhear. "I am Grand Provost now. I don't think we should flout the High Priestess on such a minor matter as titles."<br><br>"It is not a minor matter," Cannan briskly contradicted me. "You are a member of the royal family with a right to the throne&#x2014;<em>our</em> Queen. The High Priestess will have no choice but to tolerate our insolence, for we will address you in no other way."<br><br>I bit my lip, exasperated but not knowing how to articulate it in light of their loyalty.<br><br>"Won't you sit, then?" I managed to say, gesturing toward several armchairs.<br><br>"No. We wouldn't want to offend our <em>delegate"</em><br><br>It was Steldor who had spoken, his infamous temper sizzling as he referenced Narian, though it was not the same anger that I had come to know during our tumultuous marriage, which had ended when he'd sought an annulment from the church out of respect for my wishes. No, this anger was deeply rooted, born out of pain, oppression and the knowledge that the man he held at least partly responsible for Hytanica's destruction would join us at any moment.<br><br>Cannan glanced at his son, sympathy and an admonition in his gaze, then more civilly expressed the sentiment.<br><br>"We'll stand, at least until Narian arrives."<br><br>With no choice but to accept this decision, I continued to wait with them in awkward silence, my nervousness growing with each passing second, for I knew what Narian would say. I had called this meeting at his behest, both of us having recognized that the request needed to come from me if there were to be any chance of getting provincial rule off to a decent start.<br><br>It was not a sound but the stiffening of backs that told me Narian had arrived. I turned to face the door opposite the one the Hytanican men had used, the one that led into the Throne Room&#x2014;or what had been the Throne Room&#x2014;and saw him standing there. Like the others, he was several inches taller than me and well-muscled, though we all knew his power ranged beyond the physical. His deep blue eyes went briefly to me, then he appraised the former military men who, despite their stoicism, could not conceal their enmity, and quietly closed the door.<br><br>"Gentlemen," Narian said, the word a touch too well pronounced. "Grand Provost Alera."<br><br>The formality Narian maintained toward me in official capacities was essential. We had repaired our relationship, but the province was not ready to learn of it. And though the present company was knowledgeable of the affection between us, they were far from ready to accept it.<br><br>I nodded, although no one else issued a welcome. Narian, who was cool and controlled almost to a fault and had long ago given up hope of befriending these men, ignored their disrespect.<br><br>"I bring word from the High Priestess," he informed them in his subtle accent, stepping farther into the room, London also joining the group. "I suggest you seat yourselves. She has much to say."<br><br>When none of the men stirred, I moved to occupy an armchair, thinking they would follow my lead. They did not, and I wondered if they would have seated themselves if the suggestion had not come from Narian.<br><br>Ignoring their effrontery once more, Narian proceeded to untie a leather cylinder from his belt, removing a scroll from within it. My heart pounded as though it alone were driving blood through everyone's veins. He unrolled the document and began to read.<br><br>"Upon this Twenty-second Day of May in the First Year of Cokyrian dominance over the Province of Hytanica, the following regulations are put into place, to be conveyed directly to Hytanica's upper tier&#x2014;" Narian nodded to the men assembled, whom the proclamation indicated "&#x2014;and posted throughout the city and countryside so that no citizen may avoid accountability by a plea of ignorance. The violation of any rule herein established will be punished severely, with bodily harm, imprisonment or execution.<br><br>"Regulation One. The possession of weapons of war by any Hytanican man, woman or child, other than the Grand Provost's bodyguard, is strictly prohibited. All such weapons must be surrendered immediately to Cokyrian forces. Permitted are farm implements, one ax per household for the chopping of wood, cutlery, tools for construction and daggers under six inches long by the blade."<br><br>Cannan motioned to Steldor and Galen, both of whom met his gaze in a silent challenge before simultaneously reaching into their right boot shafts and withdrawing daggers that contravened this law. Each flipped his knife around to catch the blade before extending it to Narian, who confiscated the weapons with a cold stare they gladly returned. After laying the daggers on the table beside the chair in which I sat, Nar-ian again unfurled the parchment.<br><br>"Regulation Two. Cokyri will maintain complete control over access in and out of the city. Cokyrian soldiers will man the gate and may subject any passers to search and seizure with or without cause.<br><br>"Three. The borders of the Hytanican Province will be guarded by Cokyrian soldiers during and after the construction of the Province Wall. No citizen may cross the border without explicit permission from the Commander of the Cokyrian Forces within the province, such permission to be evidenced by the seal of the High Priestess."<br><br>I looked at the ring on Narian's right hand, knowing that London would also recognize it as the Overlord's, for he had stolen it while a prisoner and had worn it for seventeen years. The twin to the ring resided on the hand of the High Priestess; thus Narian had the ability to provide her seal.<br><br>"Four. The Hytanican Province will maintain no military force of its own. The former military base will belong exclusively to Cokyrian soldiers, who alone will be the peacekeeping force within the city and throughout the countryside. The military school will continue in a strictly academic capacity, for the intellectual betterment of the province's youth, both male and female.<br><br>"Five. Foreign trade will recommence following the completion of the Province Wall in order to accelerate the recovery of the province's economy. However, all tradesmen will be searched and those carrying impermissible items will be turned away.<br><br>"Six. Hunting parties will register with the Cokyrian Weaponry Officer in order to receive permission and appropriate arms. At the conclusion of the hunt, all weapons shall be returned to Cokyrian control."<br><br>My eyes roved over the men, knowing how offended they had to be by these constraints, but I could detect no reaction beyond the seething resentment of the younger pair. Cannan's gaze did not falter, and his face remained impassive. Halias, relying on habit to rein in his sentiments, stood at attention with his hands clasped behind his back, staring somewhere past his captain, Narian not even in his line of sight. But London's aspect perplexed me, for he looked resigned, yet I had never known him to bow to authority.<br><br>"Seven. Harvested crops will be divided with twenty percent delivered to Cokyri and eighty percent remaining within the province. Special Cokyrian envoys will be in charge of coordinating the planting and farming effort.<br><br>"And Eight. A tax will be imposed on trade and businesses in the amount of ten percent of earnings, in accordance with rules to be established by the Cokyrian tax collector."<br><br>The ensuing silence was thick, the Hytanicans no doubt having been ordered by the captain not to respond. The High Priestess might have declared that Hytanica no longer had a military, but these men still had a chain of command.<br><br>"The people revere you and will follow your example," Narian concluded, rolling up the parchment and looking at each man in turn. "If you abide by these laws, this province can prosper. The Hytanican people can know peace."<br><br>"We can live comfortable half lives, you mean," Steldor retorted. He had changed so much since his brush with death, but when angered, he still had difficulty controlling his tongue.<br><br>"For now, comfort is more than you have the right to expect. You are a conquered people, and the High Priestess is being exceptionally generous."<br><br>Galen's hand fell on his friend's shoulder. Neither he nor Steldor had spared a glance for me throughout this meeting, perhaps because they knew where my convictions lay. I had been first among my people to see these regulations, and though they intimidated me, it was my responsibility to encourage cooperation between Hytanica and Cokyri. I had negotiated with the Overlord to allow my people to exit our conquered homeland, preferring a nomadic life to one of tyranny, and later had signed a treaty with the High Priestess to permit our return. But we were now a Cokyrian province, and that status brought restrictions. With time, limitations would be lessened and we would be granted more privileges. I had to make sure we survived this difficult stage to find a better one, for everyone's sake.<br><br>I came to my feet, intending to say something, but London interceded.<br><br>"Narian's right. Were the Overlord alive and in command, we would likely be enslaved."<br><br>I could have sworn gratitude graced Narian's countenance, for London was reminding the others that the eighteen-year-old had paved the way to the Overlord's destruction when he had challenged his master in the clearing to protect me. It had been the High Priestess, however, who had delivered the final blow, saving Narian's life by slitting her brother's throat when she had realized that his evil exceeded her control. The other men grudgingly accepted London's point and Narian moved on with the meeting.<br><br>"There is one more issue to address&#x2014;the positions you men will hold in this new Hytanica. The High Priestess feels it would be unwise to leave you to your own devices."<br><br>This was spoken as a warning, and Narian let the words hang in the air for a moment before he went on.<br><br>"Each of you is hereby given certain duties. London has already taken up the role of Alera's bodyguard and will remain in that post. Cannan, you will operate from your old office in an advisory capacity to Alera while she learns to govern the province. As for the rest of you, the city is in dire need of repairs, and you will be assigned to that task, working with the Cokyrians who are managing the effort. Steldor, you are assigned to the southern section of the city, Galen to the west and Halias to the east. The north will remain under my jurisdiction."<br><br>I could sense indignation flaring within Steldor&#x2014;his pride was enormous, while Galen was less easily offended; and Cannan, Halias and London had the presence of mind and the years under their belts to take what they were handed. None of them, however, was pleased with the current state of affairs, and I feared how long their subdued attitudes would last.<br><br>"Why not simply execute us?" Steldor asked, his jaw tight, no doubt thinking of his uncle Baelic's fate after Hytanica had surrendered.<br><br>"To appease the public," Narian snapped.<br><br>"Very well," Cannan said, holding up a hand to stifle his son. "I assume that's all?"<br><br>His words sounded like a dismissal rather than a question, a harsh reminder that there was no enjoyment to be found for him or his men in Narian's company. There was a tense pause, and I could feel an immense struggle for power beneath the surface.<br><br>"Yes.

Recommended.&#x201d; <br>--<em>The Yes Guide</em> <br> <br>This work deals with natal astrology in a manner never before attempted by any author. The first of its three parts explains the theoretical aspect of esoteric astrology; the second demonstrates the practical side of esoteric astrology with many examples and complete explanations; and the third part deals with the subdivisions of the Zodiac. <br> <br>For the first time in the history of astrology, an entirely new method of reading horoscopes is given. The individual and personal stars of all individuals are explained by a series of star maps, showing how the age of the soul may be astrologically discovered. The author provides complete instructions for creating a star map from a horoscope. Methods are also given for interpreting a chart in terms of reincarnation and the working out of Karma. <br> <br>&#x201c;Today, my whole belief in the science of the stars stands or falls with Karma and Reincarnation and I have no hesitation in saying that without these ancient teachings, natal astrology has no permanent value.&#x201d; <br>--The Author <br></p><h2>The Wild Creatures</h2><p>The Wild Creatures brings togetehr all the stories of Sam D&#39;Allesandro, a young voice whose life was tragically snuffed out at age 31 at the height of the AIDS epipemic in 1988.

At no time more than our own is this need to retrieve the shards of broken conscience more urgent."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>This clarion call to rethink our moral and political behavior examines the idea of conscience and the role conscience plays in our relationships to government, law, ethics, religion, human nature and God&#x2015;and to each other. From Abraham to Abu Ghraib, from the dissenting prophets to Darfur, Rabbi Harold Schulweis probes history, the Bible and the works of contemporary thinkers for ideas about both critical disobedience and uncritical obedience. He illuminates the potential for evil and the potential for good that rests within us as individuals and as a society.</p><p>By questioning religion's capacity&#x2015;and will&#x2015;to break from mindless conformity, Rabbi Schulweis challenges us to counter our current suppressive culture of obedience with the culture of moral compassion, and to fulfill religion's obligation to make room for and carry out courageous moral dissent.</p></p><p><p><strong>Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis</strong>, one of the most respected spiritual leaders and teachers of his generation, has been a rabbi at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, California, for close to forty years. He is the founding chairman of the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, an organization that identifies and offers grants to those non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews threatened by the agents of Nazi savagery. He is also the founder of Jewish World Watch, which aims to raise moral consciousness within the Jewish community. Synagogues and other religious institutions are now supporting this effort across the country.</p><p><strong>Rabbi Schulweis</strong> is the author of many books, including: <em>Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey</em> (Jewish Lights), <em>Approaches to the Philosophy of Religion, For Those Who Can't Believe, Finding Each Other in Judaism, In God's Mirror, </em>and two books of original religious poetry and meditation&#x2015;<em>From Birth to Immortality </em>and<em> Passages in Poetry</em>. His <em>Evil and the Morality of God</em> is regarded as a classic.</p><p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out when one receives a letter from a charity informing one that whether they had two million or ninety million invested with Madoff that something is wrong with our world. One of the wisest men I have met, Rabbi Harold M. Schulweis has written <em>Conscience: The Duty to Obey and the Duty to Disobey</em> (Jewish Lights $19.99). It is pertinent today as it is in discussing the Old Testament.</p><p>Oddly enough, Hebrew had no word for "conscience", modern Hebrew has the word &#x201c;matzpun&#x201d; which is derived from the Hebrew &#x201c;tzafun&#x201d; which connotes hiddenness. The major question Schulweis addresses is &#x201c;What is the appropriate response to divine laws that run against the grain of conscience? He points out Abraham's dialogue with God over God&#x2019;s intention to kill all of Sodom. God is not the implacable authoritarian commander whose plans cannot be questioned. Rabbi Schulweis points to Moses convinces God that the second commandment to visit the sins of the father on the next generation was wrong. As we talked, I did ask Rabbi Schulweis, &#x201c;Does God have a conscience?&#x201d;</p><p>In the light of torture at Abu Ghraib in our days, one can use the question, &#x201c;Must an immoral law, divinely given, be observed?&#x201d; God&#x2019;s Law or Halacha must have conscience, and yet changing times can have their affect. By what sort of logic are divine laws overturned? In the case of a wife suspected of adultery, she was to drink the waters of bitterness and hear the priest give a horrible curse. If she was guilty, her body would swell and her thighs would &#x201c;fall away&#x201d;. To change a bad law requires compassionate conscience and moral courage.</p><p>Conscience allows us to tell truth to power, which is the irony that Eli Weisel&#x2019;s Foundation should have lost so much money in the Madoff debacle. Where were those who questioned the man&#x2019;s investing policies who did not speak up? Does greed overcome conscience? He quotes Thomas Malthus and Herbert Spencer that attend the voice of conscience and our economy will be drained and our energy exhausted.</p><p>Rabbi Schulweis told me about his foundation, the Jewish Foundation for the Righteous, dedicated to the study and recognition of the phenomenon of Christian rescuers and to raise funds so that in their waning years they have some security, recognition and material help. So far they have given help to over 2,000. He includes in the book the remarkable help given to the Jews in the Holocaust by diplomats who gave over and above documents to rescue them from the Naziis. Among those mentioned are Aristides de Sousa Mendes of Portugal and Sempo Sugihara of Japan.</p><p>Rabbi Schulweis ends the book with the thought that we are frozen in the overwhelming bias toward the duty to obey without question. A fact that has led us to war in Iraq and blind belief in an economic fantasy led by a duplicitous Pied Piper.</p> (CONNIE MARTINSON <i>Beverly Hills Courier</i>)</p><h2>I&#39;m a man: Sex, gods, and rock &#39;n&#39; roll</h2><p>What makes men strum invisible guitars, and what does Greek mythology have to do with rock&#39;n&#39;roll?

From unicorns and dragons to elephants, lions, and monkeys, medieval society was fascinated with animals, whether they actually existed or not. The more fantastic the creature, the greater its hold seems to have been on the fertile imaginations of the Middle Ages. Both art and literature abound with vividly concocted examples of Gothic monsters (gargoyles and griffins), bizarre ideas about real if exotic beasts (lions were believed to be born dead and resurrected by the father lion three days later), and strange visions of composite creatures (such as a widely accepted animal believed to be a cross between an ant and a lion). Featuring the celebrated collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, &#34;The Medieval Menagerie&#34; is illustrated with the splendid and amusing beasts found in medieval painting, sculpture, architecture and decorative arts, as wello as in bestiaries and manuscripts. The text explores the depiction and the meaning of real and imaginary animals in medieval art. Elegant, lively and intelligent, &#34;The Medieval Managerie&#34; captures some of the wildest creatures ever to grace a Gothic cathedral.</p><p></p><h2>The Middle Temple Murder</h2><p>1980, unabridged, unaltered republication (of a work originally published in 1918), trade paperback edition, Dover, NY. 256 pages.

This award-winning book was praised by critics, chefs, and home cooks alike as the ultimate source of recipes and information about a legendary style of cooking. Wolfert's recipes for cassoulet and confit literally changed the American culinary scene. Confit, now ubiquitous on restaurant menus, was rarely served in the United States before Wolfert presented it. </p><p>Now, twenty-plus years later, Wolfert has completely revised her groundbreaking book. In this new edition, you'll find sixty additional recipes&#x2014;thirty totally new recipes, along with thirty updated recipes from Wolfert's other books. Recipes from the original edition have been revised to account for current tastes and newly available ingredients; some have been dropped. </p><p>You will find superb classic recipes for cassoulet, sauce p�rigueux, salmon rillettes, and beef daube; new and revised recipes for ragouts, soups, desserts, and more; and, of course, numerous recipes for the most exemplary of all southwest French ingredients&#x2014;duck&#x2014;including the traditional method for duck confit plus two new, easier variations. </p><p>Other recipes include such gems as Chestnut and C�pe Soup With Walnuts, magnificent lusty Oxtail Daube, mouthwatering Steamed Mussels With Ham, Shallots, and Garlic, as well as Poached Chicken Breast, Auvergne-Style, and the simple yet sublime Potatoes Baked in Sea Salt. You'll also find delicious desserts such as Batter Cake With Fresh Pears From the Corr�ze, and Prune and Armagnac Ice Cream. </p><p>Each recipe incorporates what the French call a truc, a unique touch that makes the finished dish truly extraordinary. Evocative new food photographs, including sixteen pages in full color, now accompany the text. </p><p>Connecting the 200 great recipes is Wolfert's unique vision of Southwest France. In sharply etched scenes peopled by local characters ranging from canny peasant women to world-famous master chefs, she captures the region's living traditions and passion for good food. </p><p>Gascony, the P�rigord, Bordeaux, and the Basque country all come alive in these pages. This revised edition of The Cooking of Southwest France is truly another Wolfert classic in its own right.</p><b>The culinary classic, now completely revised and enhanced with sixty new recipes</b><p><b><i>The Cooking of Southwest France</i></b></p><p>"A true culinary zealot, Paula Wolfert champions forgotten dishes, uncovers regional cooking in surprising places, and reminds us of our resources and roots.

Our churches often see spirituality as personal and private. But we cannot go long in our Christian pilgrimage before realizing that isolation leads to spiritual barrenness. We soon discover that our souls long for accompaniment, intimacy and spiritual friendship. As a result, many Christians today are rediscovering the ancient practice of spiritual direction. </p><p>In this inviting guide, David Benner introduces readers to the riches of spiritual friendship and direction, explaining what they are and how they are practiced. Spiritual direction moves beyond mere moral lifestyle accountability and goes deeper than popular notions of mentoring or discipling. Through prayerful, guided attunement to God's activity, sacred companions provide care for the soul. </p><p>If we are to experience significant spiritual formation and growth, our souls must be nurtured through spiritual companions. Benner, well-accustomed to God's work through relationships, models the kind of traveling companion who can move us toward deeper intimacy with God. </p><p>"Only real depth will serve us now. The marketplace of possibilities has sent the Western mind and heart into a tailspin. David Benner's excellent teaching is a way out of the tailspin and into the depth. This is mature religion and will feed us all well." Rev. Richard Rohr, O.F.M., Center for Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, New Mexico "Many Christians in our day are discovering (or rediscovering) ancient wisdom about the Way of Christ that brings life. David Benner is a welcome guide on this journey, both because of his clarity and because he, too, is a pilgrim." John Ortberg, teaching pastor, Willow Creek Community Church, and author of The Life You've Always Wanted</p></p><p>David G. Benner is director of the Institute for Psychospiritual Health and Distinguished Professor of Psychology and Spirituality at the Psychological Studies Institute in Atlanta, Georgia. An experienced spiritual director and retreat leader, Benner is the author and editor of many books, including the Baker Encyclopedia of Psychology and Counseling and Care of Souls. He is an executive editor of the journal Conversations.Spiritual direction is in vogue, although like so many other practices found in contemporary spiritual expression, it's a time-honored discipline for spiritual development. Benner, with impressive credentials in depth-psychology and psychoanalysis and author or editor of multiple books in the field, gives evangelical Christians a gentle introduction to spiritual direction and friendship, and to the mystical knowledge of God in which these practices are rooted. He acknowledges early in the book the skepticism of his intended audience. "Protestants are often suspicious of mysticism," he writes, linking this observation to a criticism of excessively intellectual processing of God's word as revealed in the Bible and as proclaimed from the pulpit by centuries of preachers. There is another way of knowing God, Benner suggests, and spiritual direction is a useful and legitimate tool for working toward this theologically unimpeachable aim. He uses the Protestant-friendly language of "spiritual discipline" and "prayer" and widens the meaning of these terms by adding Catholic figures such as Ignatius Loyola, Thomas Merton and Henri Nouwen to the mix. He also draws upon early Christian history and its practice of centering prayer. His writing is occasionally repetitive and abstract too many words circling around a core of meaning. On the whole, however, Benner's book represents a vital attempt to stoke the fire of spirit in order to grow in Christian faith. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Absolutely</h2><p><b>The absolutely fabulous Joanna Lumley opens her private albums for this illustrated memoir</b>&nbsp;The real-life scrapbook of the woman known as AbFab's&nbsp;Patsy Stone,&nbsp;this is an&nbsp;intimate&nbsp;memoir of one of Britain's undisputed national treasures. A former model and Bond girl, her distinctive voice has been supplied for animated characters, film narration, and AOL's "You've got mail" notification in the UK. She&nbsp;discusses speaking out as a human rights activist for Survival International and the recent Gurkha Justice Campaign,&nbsp;for which she&nbsp;is now considered a "national treasure" of Nepal because of her support. She has won two BAFTA awards, but it is the sheer diversity of her life that makes her story so compelling&#x2014;early years in Kashmir and Malaya, growing up in Kent, then a photographic model before becoming an actress, appearing in a huge range of roles.</p><p><b>Joanna Lumley</b> is an actress and one-time Bond girl best known for her role in <i>Absolutely Fabulous</i>.There is a Joanna Lumley for everyone: there's beautiful angelic Joanna, hot sexy Joanna, Kick-ass "Purdey" Joanna, heroic single mum Joanna, comic genius Joanna and crusading Gurkha-saver Joanna. And thanks to her habit of insanely hoarding everything from bales of cloth to old wrapping paper, she has pictures of every incarnation, which are lushly reproduced in her immensely fun scrapbook-memoir, Absolutely. EVENING STANDARD Her beauty does not fade and her unquenchable spirit for adventure seems more apparent than ever. Joanna Lumley is, for many, something of a national treasure. In this new illustrated memoir, we trot through her childhood in Kashmir...to her days of modelling in the Swinging Sixties and her move into acting. Luckily for fans, Lumley is a committed hoarder so there is a wealth of fantastic photographs and press cuttings to feast upon. DAILY EXPRESS Mischievous and measured, Joanna Lumley gives us a remarkable portrait of a groovy life...Lots of facts, little hyperbole and a pervasive sense of self effacement, a very British talent for understatement and self-deprecation and (and this, in an age of vomit-into-the-void celebrity culture is perhaps what stands out and pleases the most) restraint...that makes this such a refreshing read...she gives us the facts - and photographs - from a life astonishingly rich in experience. -- Sarah Vine THE TIMES A full-page photograph at the begining of Joanna Lumley's glossy memoir shows the nation's darling in full evening dress, wearing a glittering tiara...crimson sash and gold star...The portrait captures perfectly the mixture of poshness and larkiness that has captivated Joanna Lumley's audiences...Tempting as it is to concentrate on the wealth of photographs, it would be a pity to ignore the linking text. Joanna writes beautifully, managing to be both thoughtful and amusing. -- Jane Shilling DAILY MAIL Lumley has done it all, from sex kitten and TV star to activist for the Gurkhas. Read about it here.' - No.2 of The Independent's 'Ten Best New Memoirs THE INDEPENDENT An actress with an extraordinarily varied life that has taken her from Kashmir to kent, from Bond girl to Ab Fab. It's all here in this gloriously illustrated, entertaining memoir, that's packed with personal photos and reminiscences. WOMAN &amp; HOME Joanna Lumley's Absolutely is what Alan Sugar would probably call "a breath of fresh air in a world full of c***". Like Winner and Sugar, she has published memoirs before, and so this is a picture book, with words - thousands of pictures of Lumley as a child, a model, an actress, and as her dark ego Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous...She writes beautifully, too; unlike the authors above, she does not scream into the Dictaphone but respects her readers enough to compose sentences and read back over them when she has finished. -- Tanya Gold THE DAILY TELEGRAPH She's the glamorous age-defying star of stage and screen, who is famous as Patsy from Ab Fab yet a passionate human rights campaigner.

Yet there have been few serious studies of it and no full analysis of its architecture and meaning.Ebba Koch is the only scholar who has been permitted to take measurements of the complex. She has been working on the palaces and gardens of Shah Jahan for thirty years and on the Taj Mahal itself&#x2014;the tomb of the emperor's wife, Mumtaz Mahal&#x2014;for a decade.<br><br>The tomb represents the house of the queen in Paradise, and the author shows how its setting was based on the palace gardens of the great nobles that lined both sides of the river at Agra. She leads the reader through the entire complex of the Taj Mahal, with an explanation of each building and an account of the mausoleum's urban setting, its design and construction, its symbolic meaning, and its history up to the present day.<br><br>The book features hundreds of new photographs plus drawings by the Indian architect Richard Barraud that include plans and reconstructions of Agra and the Taj complex as they looked in Shah Jahan's time.</p><p><b>Ebba Koch</b> is Professor of Art History at the University of Vienna. Her Mughal Architecture has become the standard work on the subject. 378 illustrations, 218 in color.Though readers may know that Shah Jahan of India's seventeenth-century Mogul dynasty built the Taj Mahal, an immense funerary garden palace and compound, in the memory of his beloved queen Mumtaz, Koch, architectural advisor to the Taj Mahal Conservation Collaborative, provides groundbreaking analysis of the structure's architecture and importance. This gorgeous, large-scale, and accessibly scholarly volume combines eye-pleasing delight with detailed explanations of the monument's design, construction, symbolism, and history, including its sociopolitical context. Indian architect Richard Barraud's drawings reconstruct the Taj complex as it looked in Shah Jahan's time, providing views into the past, as this complex was designed and built as an integral element of Mogul Agra, a garden city along the Yamuna River. Complete with the genealogy of Shah Jahan, numerous color and black-and-white photographs, precise measurements of the entire compound, a glossary, and more, this is an unparalleled resource for aficionados of Muslim Indian culture and architecture. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Reprint.</p><p>Chesler, author of the bestselling Woman and Madness, explores the "shadow side" of sisterhood: women treating each other badly. How could her own mother have been so mean to her? How could someone who "borrowed" published ideas from her not acknowledge her or say "thank you"? In this treatise on breaking the "cycle of cruelty" between women, controversial feminist Chesler addresses why sisters fight, why some women prefer to work for men rather than for women, and other highly subjective cases of woman/woman cruelty. From the "demented Demeters" and "murderous Electras" of Greek mythology to modern-day Mommie Dearest, Chesler warns, mothers and daughters are doomed. Whether they acknowledge their mothers' viciousness, as Chesler does, or whether they're "unconscious" and suffer "amnesia" about the hurt, she says, the patterns are set. Throughout girlhood and into adult life, women repeat the basic lesson in Chesler's words, "maternal envy teaches daughters to be passive, fearful, conformist, obedient as well as similarly cruel to other women." Thus, she says, "an assertive woman manager might be viewed as bitchy and non-maternal." This comment is certainly more digestible than, say, "what complicates the aging process is a woman's life-long experience of all other women as rivals and potential replacements." Chesler draws her evidence from interviews with an unspecified group of women with horror stories: backstabbing by feminist colleagues, sadistic gynecologists, battering lesbians, etc. Needless to say, her book sometimes comes off as quite cynical, despite her claim that "I would like women to treat each other in good ways."

Here is the food Eva loves to eat, and the recipes in <em>Eva&#x2019;s Kitchen</em> trace her life story, taking readers on her culinary journey&#x2014;from the food she was brought up on to the recipes inspired by her travels abroad to the dishes she serves during casual nights at home.<br><br> Having grown up on a ranch with every meal based on what was in the family fields, Eva believes, like so many of us, that good cooking relies on local, fresh, easy-to-find ingredients. In <em>Eva&#x2019;s Kitchen</em>, she teaches readers essential cooking skills and she sprinkles in the histories and traditions behind her favorite dishes, including personal stories and anecdotes that capture the warmth, humor, and joy of her most memorable meals.<br> <br>In her first cookbook, Eva welcomes you into her kitchen, offering 100 of her favorite dishes&#x2014;many of which are family recipes collected over the years&#x2014;all fused with her passion for cooking. She also shares memories of her Texas ranch upbringing, her very first cooking adventures, vacations overseas, nights in with her girlfriends, and last-minute pre&#x2013;red carpet meals. <br> <br>Inspired by her heritage, Eva highlights the essentials of great Mexican cooking, Texas style&#x2014;with her family&#x2019;s recipes and techniques for making the world&#x2019;s best tamales, homemade tortillas, Spanish rice, and Pan de Polvo (Mexican pastry), to name a few. She also offers dishes from a variety of international cuisines, from Latin American to Italian and French, inspired by her globe-trotting travels. A taste of Lemon Dover Sole whisks Eva to a tiny hotel-restaurant she once visited on a trip to Normandy; the recipe for Cannellini Beans with Crushed Red Pepper was a souvenir from a trip to Florence; kimchi adds a kick to her Spicy Roasted Brussels Sprouts, a Thanksgiving staple; and Yellow Squash Soup with Lemon brings her full circle, back to her family&#x2019;s vegetable garden in Corpus Christi. <br> <br>With full-color food photographs, intimate portraits of her family and friends, and a glimpse into Eva&#x2019;s home and her lesser-known domestic side (family first, acting second, she says), Eva&#x2019;s debut cookbook will entice her loyal fans and inspire home cooks to broaden their culinary horizons and create memorable meals for the people they love.</p><p>Eva Longoria&nbsp;is best known for her award-winning role as Gabrielle Solis on ABC&#x2019;s mega-hit <i>Desperate Housewives</i>.

Eva is the owner, with Todd English, of Beso, an eatery in Hollywood and Las Vegas that features upscale contemporary steakhouse cuisine with a Latin flair. She is a graduate of Texas A&amp;M&#x2013;Kingsville and lives in California and Texas.My love affair with cooking started long ago, but I remember it so clearly. When I was about six years old, my mom was leaving for work early one morning and I told her I was hungry. &#x201c;So cook something!&#x201d; she answered. I vividly remember pulling up a chair to the stove and turning it on with a match. (I know&#x2014;dangerous, but it was a different time!) I selected the smallest frying pan I could fi nd because I wanted to cook one egg. Not eggs, just one egg. I cracked the egg on the edge of the pan, as I&#x2019;d seen my mom do effortlessly many times before, and emptied it into the frying pan.<br><br>Of course, the pan was full of eggshell. I didn&#x2019;t use any butter or oil, so the egg stuck everywhere. I can&#x2019;t even remember now what it tasted like, but I can recall the feeling of accomplishment I had after cooking that egg. I found it empowering and energizing. I was hooked from that day forward.<br><br>I wanted to learn everything! I wanted my little EASY-BAKE Oven to make casseroles like my mom&#x2019;s. I wanted my lemonade stand to have more flavor options than just lemon. And for Christmas I wanted my own hand mixer! I eventually graduated from cooking an egg to making my own spaghetti sauce.<br><br>I have my family to thank for my cooking skills and the inspiration they gave me to begin my own culinary journey. My dad was a big believer in never eating fast food, so we were not allowed to have it. And nothing ever went to waste. I grew up on a ranch outside of Corpus Christi, Texas, and throughout my childhood my family grew our own vegetables and raised our own chickens. Every day my mom cooked with garden-fresh calabasa (squash), carrots, and beans, and freshly laid eggs. Every last bit of that garden&#x2019;s harvest was always used, and any trimmings went right to the compost pile. She worked full-time as a special education teacher; took care of my oldest sister, who is developmentally disabled; and had three other daughters to drive all over town to cheerleading, band practice, work, and everywhere else busy teenage girls need to go. But in spite of it all, she always managed to have dinner on the table every night at 6P.M. for my dad. This was such an important lesson in my life. The fact that my mother clearly reveled in taking care of her family in addition to having a career inspired me to be the same way. I cannot count the number of times that I&#x2019;ve found myself in a Gucci dress and heels&#x2014;with full hair and makeup, about to run out to an event&#x2014;pulling a roasted chicken out of the oven in order to make sure that my family is fed before leaving the house to face a hundred photographers on a red carpet.</p><h2>Neighbors and Wise Men: Sacred Encounters in a Portland Pub and Other Unexpected Places</h2><p><b>Hearing from God is extraordinary.

Indeed, as Ferling shows, Washington had to overcome many negative traits as he matured into a leader. The young Washington was accused of ingratitude and certain of his letters from this period read as if they were written by "a pompous martinet and a whining, petulant brat." As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, he lost his temper more than once and indulged flatterers. Aaron Burr found him "a boring, colorless person." As president, he often believed the worst about individual officials. Ferling concludes that Washington's personality and temperament were those of "a self-centered and self-absorbed man, one who since youth had exhibited a fragile self-esteem." And yet he managed to realize virtually every grand design he ever conceived. Ferling's Washington is driven, fired by ambition, envy, and dreams of fame and fortune. Yet his leadership and character galvanized the American Revolution--probably no one else could have kept the war going until the master stroke at Yorktown--and helped the fledgling nation take, and survive, its first unsteady steps. <br> This superb paperback makes available once again an unflinchingly honest and compelling biography of the father of our country.</p><p><br><strong>John Ferling</strong> is the author of nine books and numerous articles on the American Revolution and early American wars, and has appeared in four television documentaries devoted to the Revolution and the War of Independence.

The young Washington was accused of ingratitude, and certain of his letters from this period read as if they were written by "a pompous martinet and a whining, petulant brat." As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, he lost his temper more than once and may have indulged a flatterer or two on his staff. Aaron Burr found him "a boring, colorless person." As president, he was ready to believe the worst about individual officials, before all the evidence was in. Ferling concludes that Washington's personality and temperament were those of "a self-centered and self-absorbed man, one who since youth had exhibited a fragile self-esteem."

In a series of nine workshops, Bliss, a prolific British knitwear designer and author, covers all the major areas of knitting, starting with a beginner's workshop and progressing through simple stitch patterns, aran knitting, color work (Fair Isle and Intarsia), lace, entrelac, decorative details, knitwear design, and finishing. Each workshop includes step-by-step instructions, a stitch library, and several projects. Full-color illustrations abound.

Poor yet high-spirited, lovers of both literature and nature, the Sherwoods of Cornwall, N.Y. were more concerned with doing good than making good and were rewarded internally rather than with monetary success. As Hodges states: "There was in them what Americans like to think of as the essential American character, the will to make a difference." The story begins with Mary, the matriarch of the family, and ends by recounting the life of Sidney, the youngest child. Throughout the book, all characters accrue an impressive list of accomplishments in such various realms as women's rights, education, medicine, psychology, writing and politics. Equally impressive is the list of family friends, among them Woodrow Wilson, Eleanor Roosevelt and Susan B. Anthony. Hodges chooses not to embellish characterizations, but reveals each family member's personality through journal entries, letters and the observations of acquaintances. While some readers may find this objective approach tedious, others will recognize and appreciate the tremendous amount of research that went into this, as well as Hodges's dedication to historical fact, her eye for detail and interest in truth. Ages 12-up. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 6 Up-- Mary Sherwood, after being widowed at the turn of the century, brought up five children with love and courage, creating a home that both they and their friends would find welcoming and supportive throughout their lives. She lived to be almost 100, leaving a legacy of a crusading family: daughters dedicated to the environment, wildlife, health care, and education, and a son whose career was international relations. She was also a friend of Eleanor Roosevelt's, who admired Mary tremendously, as does the author of this book. Adulatory asides and "she must have thoughts" attributes frame a book so intent upon the relentless minutiae of the lives of these people--taken from diaries and letters--and so colored by personal admiration that whatever was real, or important in their lives, fails to come forth. One's own affections are not necessarily of interest to other people, unless one can somehow communicate that specialness and make an audience feel the same way; and for young readers, both the subject and the manner of telling should be tailored to their sensibilities. This is a pleasant, self-indulgent memoir without any remarkable qualities of either style or content. --Marjorie Lewis, Scarsdale Junior High School, N.Y.<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fresh Elastic for Stretched Out Moms</h2><p>Her oldest son was killed in Vietnam. Five years later, to the day, another son died in a head-on car collision. Then another son, a practicing homosexual, left home and didn&#39;t tell his family where he went.
